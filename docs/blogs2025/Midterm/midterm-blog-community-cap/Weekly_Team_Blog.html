<section id="introduction" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>This blog looks at how Iowa counties are doing across seven Community Capitals:</p>
<p><a href="imgs/capitals.png" class="lightbox" data-gallery="quarto-lightbox-gallery-1"><img src="imgs/capitals.png" class="img-fluid" style="width:50.0%" alt="Seven Community Capitals"></a></p>
<p><sub>Image Source: <a href="https://www.southwind.k-state.edu/newspaper_articles/Finding%20your%20Communities%20Capitals-Amanda%20September%202023.pdf" target="_blank">Kansas State Extension, 2023</a></sub></p>
<p>We use data from the American Community Survey (ACS), the State Library of Iowa, and the U.S. Religion Census to explore questions like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Do strong counties do well in one area or many?<br>
</li>
<li>Where are the mismatches—like good infrastructure but weak culture?<br>
</li>
<li>What can we learn from counties that stand out or fall behind?</li>
</ul>
<p>We look for patterns, surprises, and lessons using both data and local knowledge.</p>
<p>As Scott Thompson said, “Social capital doesn’t just come from meetings. It shows up in potlucks, cleanup crews, and people who still wave from tractors.” (Daily Yonder, 2020)</p>
</section>
<section id="project-goals" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="project-goals">Project Goals</h2>
<ul>
<li>See which counties and cities are doing well in areas like education, income, housing, and civic life<br>
</li>
<li>Find places where things don’t match up like high income but low civic engagement, or good housing but low education<br>
</li>
<li>Spot patterns and outliers that help explain why some places succeed and others struggle<br>
</li>
<li>Group similar cities and counties into types or tiers to compare them more easily<br>
</li>
<li>Show how local efforts like broadband or housing programs can make a difference<br>
</li>
<li>Explore how location, size, or local economy affect a community’s opportunities</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="housing-changes-in-small-iowa-cities" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="housing-changes-in-small-iowa-cities">Housing Changes in Small Iowa Cities</h2>
<p>We looked at cities with 8,000 to 12,000 people to see how local efforts may be shaping housing quality.</p>
<section id="tier-1-strong-cities" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="tier-1-strong-cities">Tier 1 – Strong Cities</h4>
<p>Cities: Bondurant, Pleasant Hill, Sioux Center, Waverly, Pella, Le Mars</p>
<p>What Worked and Why:</p>
<ul>
<li>These cities planned ahead expanding roads, sewers, and broadband before growth took off.</li>
<li>They supported builders with zoning reforms and tax incentives. Strong design rules and housing rehab programs helped maintain housing quality.</li>
</ul>
<p>Population: Most Tier 1 cities are growing, especially Bondurant, Sioux Center, and Pleasant Hill.</p>
</section>
<section id="tier-2-moderate-cities" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="tier-2-moderate-cities">Tier 2 – Moderate Cities</h4>
<p>Cities: Carroll, Storm Lake, Denison</p>
<p>What Worked and Why:</p>
<ul>
<li>Used grants and partnerships to repair older homes.</li>
<li>Encouraged infill housing and broadband improvements.</li>
<li>Many efforts started after 2018, so impacts are still developing.</li>
</ul>
<p>Population: All three saw modest growth, but at a slower pace than Tier 1.</p>
</section>
<section id="tier-3-cities-that-need-support" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="tier-3-cities-that-need-support">Tier 3 – Cities That Need Support</h4>
<p>Cities: Grinnell, Spencer, Fairfield, Mount Pleasant, Oskaloosa, Fort Madison, Keokuk</p>
<p>What Worked and Why:</p>
<ul>
<li>Some sewer and broadband upgrades were made.</li>
<li>Small-scale housing rehab was tried, often with federal or state help.</li>
<li>Why It Wasn’t Enough:</li>
<li>Most projects were small or limited to certain areas.</li>
<li>New housing was minimal, and old homes still dominate.</li>

<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="forest-reserve-vs.-volunteering">Forest Reserve vs.&nbsp;Volunteering</h4>
<p>Interpretation: This plot shows a slight positive relationship between the proportion of forest reserve and volunteering rate. Counties with more forest reserve land tend to have somewhat higher volunteering, though the association is still weak and uncertain.</p>
<p>Flora &amp; Flora (2008) state that natural capital provides more than ecological services; it enhances place of attachment and stewardship, which are foundations for civic life.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="natural-disasters-and-civic-engagement">Natural Disasters and Civic Engagement</h2>
<p>Interpretation: This plot reveals a moderate negative relationship between tornado frequency and volunteering rates. As tornado events increase, volunteering appears to decline slightly. This could suggest that areas more frequently impacted by tornadoes may face barriers to sustained civic engagement, potentially due to recurring disruptions or resource strain.</p>
<p>Emery &amp; Flora (2006) explicitly introduce the idea that crisis can lead to community growth through spiraling up in capitals. After events like floods, communities often develop stronger civic coordination and cultural expression</p>

<section id="education-vs.-unemployment" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="education-vs.-unemployment">Education vs.&nbsp;Unemployment</h4>
<p>Interpretation: Surprisingly, this graph shows a very small positive relationship as education goes up, unemployment also goes up a little. However, the dots are very scattered, and the trend is very weak. This means other factors may be influencing unemployment rates more than education levels alone.</p>

<p>The graph below on the left shows differences in capitals between Urban and Rural counties based on the rural urban continuum. There are 22 counties classified as Urban based on a (1-3) code and 77 counties classified as Rural based on a (4-9) code. The graph below on the right shows differences in capitals between Metropolitan, Micropolitan, and Non-Metropolitan counties based on a different slicing of the rural urban continuum. There are 22 Metropolitan counties (1-3) code, 16 Micropolitan (4-7) code, and 61 Non-Metropolitan (8-9) code.</p>

<p>Interpretation: Urban counties do better in Built, Financial, Human, and Political capitals. Rural counties do better in Cultural, Natural, and Social capitals. Metropolitan counties do the best in the same capitals as Urban counties. Non-metropolitan counties do the best in the same capitals as Rural. Micropolitan does not do the best in any capital, but places in the middle for all capitals except Social where they place last. Although the differences between the overall capital scores between counties using the rural urban continuum are not huge, many specific variables within each capital face large differences between classifications.</p>

<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="economic-dependence">Economic Dependence</h4>
<p>The graph below shows all capitals defined by all variables in the data for each capital by ERS Typology, which gives each county a category of economic dependence. Iowa counties fit into the following categories: Farm-Dependent, Federal/ State Government-Dependent, Manufacturing-Dependent, Non-Specialized, Recreation-Dependent. The second graph shows how far a capital score is from the median of all counties.</p>

<p>Interpretation: Recreation performs the highest in all capitals except Social where it performs last. Federal/state government sticks out with high political and human capital. All other economic dependency categories stay relatively flat across capitals. While non-specialized, farm-dependent, and manufacturing-dependent all hold 25-40 counties each, recreation-dependent holds only one county and federal/state government-dependent holds only three counties. This is not a fair comparison as recreation-dependent and federal/state government-dependent are highly sensitive to local conditions/ outliers in their average values, but this does give us an opportunity to expolore these counties as outliers.</p>

<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="combined-statistical-areas-csa">Combined Statistical Areas (CSA)</h4>
<p>There are seven CSA’s that select Iowa counties are apart of.</p>
<p>CSA means Combined Statistical Area. It’s a group of nearby cities and towns that are connected because many people live in one place and work in another nearby place. The government groups these places together to study how people live, work, and move around in a region.</p>

<p>Interpretation: There are significant differences in capital scores across CSA’s. From this we can identify outliers of extreme high and low scores. The Spencer-Spirit Lake, IA CSA sticks out as high in Human and Political capitals. The Burlington-Fort Madison, IA-IL CSA, sticks out low in Built and Financial capitals, but performs high in Cultural and Natural capitals.</p>

<p>Interpretation: Cities in Clay County may not contribute to the high CSA totals as much as those in Dickinson County. Cities in Dickinson County boast high, above-median human and political capital scores, except the city of Orleans, which scores below the median in both capitals. The city of Lake Park also scores below the median in political capital.These underperforming cities can weaken the CSA’s overall results, masking the full potential of its collective strengths.</p>

<p>Interpretation: Most cities in both Lee and Des Moines counties contribute to the low built and financial capital scores seen in the overall CSA, with all city scores in both capitals being below the median in Lee County. Des Moines County holds two above-median cities in the financial capital, Danville and Mediapolis, and one city above the median in the built capital with West Burlington.</p>

<p>College counties (Story, Johnson, Black Hawk) demonstrate an income-poverty paradox where high median incomes coexist with high poverty rates. This occurs because college students experience temporary low income, inflating poverty statistics while actual economic conditions may be more stable. <span class="citation" data-cites="juday2016modifypoverty">[@juday2016modifypoverty]</span></p>

<p>Story &amp; Johnson – Student Inflation</p>
<p>College towns look poorer and less employed on paper because student incomes distort the data (U.S. Census Bureau, 2016).</p>
<p>Dallas – Suburban Alignment</p>
<p>High education matches with strong jobs, incomes, and housing—thanks to Des Moines metro growth (DataDesMoines, 2023; Axios, 2022).</p>

<p>Dickinson County is the only “Recreation” county in Iowa. ERS Typology groups counties by the main kind of work people do—like farming, manufacturing, government jobs, or tourism.
