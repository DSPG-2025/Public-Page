<p><strong>Variables:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Monthly housing cost with mortgage: monthly_housing_cost_with_mortgage</li>
<li>Monthly housing cost without mortgage: monthly_housing_costs_without_mortgage</li>
<li>Monthly median gross rent: monthly_median_gross_rent</li>
<li>Internet access: median_house_value</li>
<li>No internet access: no_internet_access</li>
<li>Access to plumbing facilities: access_plumbing_facilities</li>
<li>No access to plumbing facilities: lacking_plumbing_facilities</li>
</ul>
<p>Standardized the data then construc a correlation matrix using Spearman coefficient</p>
<p>In this data transformation pipeline, several key socioeconomic indicators were calculated and standardized. The education rate was computed as the proportion of individuals with a bachelorâ€™s degree or higher relative to the total adult population, and a standardized education score was derived from it. Housing affordability was measured in three ways: the share of monthly income spent on mortgage payments, rent, and the ratio of median house value to income; each was then standardized into respective scores. Access to infrastructure was assessed by calculating the rate of internet and plumbing access in each area, with corresponding standardized scores. Commuting patterns were captured by first summing all time intervals to get total commuters, then calculating the share of commuters for each time bracket (e.g., less than 5 minutes, 10â€“14 minutes, etc.), and finally standardizing those proportions. Altogether, these metrics were transformed into z-scores to enable direct comparisons across different domains of well-being and infrastructure.</p>
<p><a href="imgs/correaltion_matrix.png" class="lightbox" data-gallery="quarto-lightbox-gallery-1"><img src="imgs/correaltion_matrix.png" class="img-fluid"></a></p>
<p>Higher education and income are generally linked to shorter commutes, higher internet scores, and better housing/plumbing. Longer commutes tend to correlate with lower socioeconomic and infrastructure indicators. Housing ownership (Mortgage Score) and renting (Rent Score) show inverse patterns across the board.</p>

<p><strong>Variables:</strong></p>
<p>Built (5 variables): Housing Burden, Mobile Homes, MultiUnit, Crowded, No Vehicle</p>
<p>Human (2 variables): No High School, Limited English</p>
<p>Financial (2 variables): Poverty, Unemployment</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="correlation-between-indicators">Correlation Between Indicators</h3>
<p>Each square compares two indicators and calculates how closely they move together.</p>
<p>The value inside each square is the Pearson correlation coefficient (from â€“1 to 1):</p>
<p>1.00 = positive correlation (both go up/down together)</p>
<p>0.00 = no correlation</p>
<p>â€“1.00 = negative correlation (one goes up, the other goes down)</p>
<p>Darker blue = stronger positive relationship</p>
<p><strong>Analysis:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>No_HighSchool, LimitedEnglish, NoVehicle, and HousingBurden are very highly correlated (values around 0.94â€“0.97).</p></li>
<li><p>Counties with low education levels often also have high housing costs, more residents with limited English, and less access to transportation.</p></li>
<li><p>Poverty and Unemployment: Only weakly correlated with other indicators here (e.g., Poverty and HousingBurden: just 0.04).</p></li>
</ul>
<p>This suggests that housing strain, language barriers, and education may be major issues even when income isnâ€™t the worst.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> Community strain is multi-dimensional. This chart shows that counties struggling in one area (like education) often struggle in others (like housing and transportation), but poverty itself doesnâ€™t always align with those issues.</p>

<p>Each bar shows how counties in a cluster score (on average) in each capital:</p>
<p><strong>What the Chart Shows</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Cluster 3 (Blue) has the highest scores in all four capitals. This means counties in this group are experiencing greater levels of challenge.</p></li>
<li><p>Cluster 2 (Green) has the lowest scores. That means counties in this group are doing better than average on all four fronts.</p></li>
<li><p>Cluster 1 (Red) sits in between. These counties show some level of vulnerability, but not as severe as Cluster 3.</p></li>
</ul>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="iii-are-there-counties-with-low-education-but-high-civic-involvement-engagement">(iii) Are there counties with low education, but high civic involvement/ engagement?</h3>
<p><strong>Variables:</strong></p>
<p>Education: (Built, Human): Public and Private Schools per 10k, Community and University Colleges per 10k, Percent of Population with High School and Bachelorâ€™s Degree</p>
<p>Civic Engagement: (Social, Political): Volunteering Rate, Civic Organizations, 2020 Decennial Response Rate, % of Total Voter Turnout, Federal and State Election Contributions</p>

<p>After grouping variables into Education and Civic Engagement, I then calculated z-scores for each variable value, calculated an average z-score for all variable values in either education or civic engagement, and calculated a correlation coefficient between education and civic engagement = 0.3527734 (not significant).</p>

<p><strong>Analysis:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Many counties high in education and civic engagement</p></li>
<li><p>Many counties low in education and civic engagement</p></li>

<p>What it shows: Each dot is an Iowa county. The x-axis shows % with a Bachelorâ€™s degree or higher; the y-axis shows % in poverty.</p>
<p>Trend line: The purple line shows the general trend. The shaded area shows uncertainty.</p>
<p>Interpretation: Counties with more college-educated people tend to have slightly lower poverty rates. The link is weak, as the data is widely spread.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="analysis-of-human-vs-financial-capital-across-counties">Analysis of Human vs Financial Capital Across Counties</h3>
<p>This chart compares Human Capital and Financial Capital for a selected county using standardized scores. These scores show how the county compares to the average across all counties in the dataset.</p>
<p>Human Capital is measured by standardized education levels.</p>
<p>Financial Capital is based on poverty and unemployment, but reversed because lower poverty and unemployment are better.</p>
<p>The scores are standardized (using scale()), meaning:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>A score of 0 = average among all counties.</p></li>
<li><p>A negative score = below average.</p></li>
<li><p>A positive score = above average.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Example: Adair County</strong></p>
<p>The Human Capital score is moderately negative, suggesting that education levels in Adair are below the state average.</p>
<p>The Financial Capital score is more strongly negative, meaning that poverty and unemployment in Adair are worse compared to other counties.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="income-vs.-volunteering-rate">Income vs.&nbsp;Volunteering Rate</h3>
<p>The graph suggests a very slight positive relationship between income and volunteering as income increases, volunteering tends to increase a little. However, the dots are widely scattered, and the trend is quite weak. This indicates that income alone may not be a strong predictor of volunteering rates, and other factors, such as community engagement or local culture, may play a larger role.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="income-vs.-education">Income vs.&nbsp;Education</h3>
<p>This graph shows a strong positive relationship between income and education. As income increases, the percentage of residents with a college degree also tends to rise. The trend is much clearer and more consistent compared to other relationships, suggesting that higher income levels are closely associated with higher educational attainment across counties. This may reflect the role of wealth in expanding access to higher education or the economic advantages held by more educated populations.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="analysis-of-human-financial-and-social-capital-across-counties">Analysis of Human, Financial, and Social Capital Across Counties</h3>
<p>This chart compares three types of capital Human, Financial, and Social for a selected county using standardized scores. These scores allow us to assess how a county performs relative to the state average across key dimensions.</p>
<p><strong>Example: Adair County</strong></p>
<p>The Human Capital score is moderately below average, suggesting lower educational attainment than the state norm.</p>
<p>The Financial Capital score is also below average, indicating higher levels of poverty and/or unemployment.</p>
<p>The Social Capital score is the lowest among the three, implying that volunteering rates in Adair are well below average compared to other counties.</p>
<p>This suggests that Adair County may face challenges in all three capital areas, particularly in civic engagement and social cohesion, as reflected in the volunteering data.</p>
