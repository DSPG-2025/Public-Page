<p>The graph suggests a slight positive relationship between housing deficiency and volunteering rate. As the proportion of deficient housing increases, the volunteering rate tends to increase. However, the wide confidence interval indicates variability and some uncertainty in this trend. This may imply that in areas with more housing challenges, community members are somewhat more likely to engage in volunteering possibly reflecting stronger community bonds.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="housing-deficiency-vs.-civic-organizations">Housing Deficiency vs.&nbsp;Civic Organizations</h2>
<p>This graph reveals a slight positive relationship between housing deficiency and civic organizations per capita. As the proportion of deficient housing increases, the number of civic organizations tends to increase slightly. While the trend is not particularly strong, it may suggest that in areas with more housing challenges, there is a slightly higher presence of civic engagement possibly as a response to community needs.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="analysis-of-built-and-social-capital-in-adair-county">Analysis of Built and Social Capital in Adair County</h2>
<p>This chart compares two critical types of community capital for counties using percentile scores from 0 to 100, where:</p>
<p><strong>How Each Capital Is Measured:</strong></p>
<p>Built Capital: Based on the proportion of deficient housing. A lower deficiency rate results in a higher Built Capital score.</p>
<p>Social Capital: Based on a combination of volunteering rates and the number of civic organizations per capita. Higher levels of community involvement and organizational presence boost this score.</p>
<p><strong>Example: Adair County</strong></p>
<p>In the chart shown for Adair County:</p>
<p>Built Capital is slightly above the median, suggesting that the county has a relatively moderate level of housing quality compared to others not among the best, but better than many.</p>
<p>Social Capital is significantly higher, placing Adair County in the top percentiles for civic engagement and community organization.</p>

<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="are-counties-with-more-public-events-and-cultural-spaces-also-more-civically-engaged">Are counties with more public events and cultural spaces also more civically engaged?</h4>
<p>The plot suggests a very slight positive relationship between the number of events per capita and the volunteering rate. Counties with more events tend to have slightly higher volunteering rates, though the relationship is weak and the data show considerable variability. The wide confidence band at higher event levels shows uncertainty due to fewer counties in that range.</p>

<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="do-counties-with-more-protected-land-and-forests-show-stronger-civic-participations-or-healthier-populations">Do counties with more protected land and forests show stronger civic participations or healthier populations?</h4>
<p>The graph suggests a very slight upward trend between forest reserve proportion and support ratio, indicating that counties with more forested land may have marginally higher support ratios. However, most counties have very low forest reserve proportions, and the data are tightly clustered at the low end of the x-axis, limiting the strength of this relationship.</p>

<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="are-counties-exposed-to-more-natural-hazards-more-likely-to-build-strong-civic-or-cultural-responses">Are counties exposed to more natural hazards more likely to build strong civic or cultural responses?</h4>
<p>This plot reveals a moderate negative relationship between tornado frequency and volunteering rates. As tornado events increase, volunteering appears to decline slightly. This could suggest that areas more frequently impacted by tornadoes may face barriers to sustained civic engagement, potentially due to recurring disruptions or resource strain. However, further investigation would be needed to determine causality.</p>

<p>Metropolitan counties do the best in Built, Financial, Human, and Political capitals. Non-metropolitan counties do the best in Cultural, Natural, and Social.

<p>Recreation performs the highest in all capitals except Social where it performs last. Federal/state government sticks out with high political and human capital. All other economic dependency categories stay relatively flat across capitals. Percentiles and quintiles show the same results. Besides recreation and federal/state government-dependent, averages do not deviate significantly from the median.</p>

<section id="limitations-1" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="limitations-1"><strong>Limitations</strong></h4>
<p>While non-specialized, farm-dependent, and manufacturing-dependent all hold 25-40 counties each, recreation-dependent holds only one county and federal/state government-dependent holds only three counties. This is not a fair comparison as recreation-dependent and federal/state government-dependent are highly sensitive to local conditions/ outliers in their average values. Again, results do not give us significant differences between economic dependence types, as averages across those with enough counties to compare are very simaler when using all variables under each capital.</p>

<p>The graphs below shows all capitals defined by all variables in the data using quintiles on the left and percentiles on the right for each capital by CSA, which is a combination of adjacent micropolitan or metropolitan counties as a statistical area. There are seven CSA’s that Iowa counties are apart of: Burlington-Fort Madison, IA-IL CSA, which contains Lee and Des Moines counties, Cedar Rapids-Iowa City, IA CSA, which contains Benton, Johnson, Jones, Linn, and Washington counties, Davenport-Moline, IA-IL CSA, which contains Clinton, Scott, and Muscatine counties, Des Moines-West Des Moines-Ames, IA CSA, which contains Boone, Dallas, Guthrie, Jasper, Madison, Marion, Polk, Story, Warren, and Mahaska counties, Omaha-Fremont, NE-IA CSA, which contains Harrison, Mills, and Pottawattamie counties, Sioux City-Le Mars, IA-NE-SD CSA, which contains Plymouth and Woodbury counties, and finally the Spencer-Spirit Lake, IA CSA, which contains Clay and Dickinson counties. The graph below these uses calculated averages based on percentiles, to see how far a value is from the median of all counties, which is shown for CSA’s below.</p>

<p>For some variables, like the Gini Income Index and Food Environment Index, averages across MSA types or ERS typologies remain close to the 50th percentile (median of all counties), indicating only minor variation between groups. For others, like percentage of small businesses, averages across MSA types or ERS typologies stray farther from the 50th percentile (median of all counties), indicating more significant variations between groups. Though, after looking through all average variable percentiles across either MSA type or ERS typology, there are very few variables with significant variations for each.</p>

<p><strong>Potential Contributing Factors</strong></p>
<p><strong>Suburban-Rural Misclassification</strong>: Due to population thresholds, some commuter suburbs might be classified as rural (especially in ACS or Census data). These residents may work urban jobs with higher wages, pushing up median income. Meanwhile, others in the same areas may work locally for much lower wages or be unemployed, inflating poverty rates.</p>
<p><strong>Effect</strong>:</p>
<p>-Raises median income via urban-connected earners</p>
<p>-Raises poverty rate via local non-earners or underemployed</p>
<p>-Keeps inequality low because incomes are not as extreme as in cities</p>
<p><strong>Limited Economic Diversity</strong>: Rural areas often lack extreme wealth concentrations found in urban centers. Even if some earn more, income ceilings are lower compared to cities.</p>
<p><strong>Effect</strong>:</p>
<p>-Inequality appears lower due to narrower income range, despite differences in livelihood quality.</p>
<p><strong>Household Composition &amp; Cost of Living</strong>:</p>
<p>-Larger rural households may have dual-income setups (e.g., both spouses working), pushing up median income.</p>
<p>-Yet, single-person or elderly households with limited resources remain vulnerable, increasing poverty rates.</p>
<p>-Lower cost of living can mask hardship in income statistics.</p>
<p><strong>Effect</strong>:</p>
<p>-Median income looks better -Poverty remains high among vulnerable groups -Overall income spread remains tight → lower Gini coefficient</p>
<p><strong>Commuting Patterns</strong>: Some rural residents commute to higher-paying city jobs (especially near metro fringes).</p>
<p><strong>This creates a bimodal population</strong>:</p>
<p>-One group with urban income -Another group with limited local income or unemployment</p>
<p><strong>Effect</strong>:</p>
<p>-Median income rises due to city-connected earners -Poverty rate high from those without access to such opportunities -Income inequality stays moderate due to few ultra-wealthy</p>
<p><strong>What To Explore Further</strong></p>
<p>-Commute Time Analysis: Match income and poverty data with average commute times to identify suburban influence in rural stats.</p>
<p>-Gini Coefficient Maps: Compare inequality within census tracts labeled as rural to detect variations.</p>
<p>-Occupation Types: Identify how remote work or medical/educational professions cluster in rural areas.</p>

<p><strong>Why do rural areas show higher rates of single parenthood?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Potential Contributing Factors</strong>:</p>
<p>-<strong>Economic Constraints</strong>: Many rural Iowans face limited employment opportunities, wage stagnation, and underemployment. Financial strain can contribute to relationship breakdowns or discourage formal partnerships like marriage.</p>
<p>-<strong>Out-Migration</strong>: Young adults often leave rural Iowa for better educational or career opportunities in urban centers. This reduces the pool of potential partners, weakens community ties, and interrupts long-term relationships.</p>
<p>-<strong>Cultural Factors</strong>: Family formation norms vary across rural regions. In some areas, early childbearing, cohabitation without marriage, or single parenting may be more socially accepted or less stigmatized than in urban areas.</p>
<p>-<strong>Service Access</strong>: Access to family planning, prenatal care, mental health services, and relationship counseling is limited in many parts of rural Iowa. This contributes to unplanned pregnancies and a lack of support for struggling relationships.</p>
<p>-<strong>Religious and Policy Influences</strong>: While rural Iowa communities often hold traditional values, they also tend to support policies that restrict abortion access and comprehensive sex education. Combined with limited reproductive healthcare, this can lead to higher rates of single parenthood following unintended pregnancies.</p>
<p><strong>Support Systems and Policy Context in Iowa</strong>:</p>
<p>-Strong Informal Networks: Rural Iowans often benefit from strong extended family and community support after separation. However, these supports cannot fully address the root causes.</p>
<p>-State Programs: Iowa offers programs like the Family Investment Program (FIP), Parent Partners, Early Head Start, and Medicaid, which help single parents with basic needs, health, and employment training. However, gaps remain:</p>
<p>-Guaranteed income pilots (e.g., UpLift) have been banned for future expansion.</p>
<p>-Childcare shortages in rural counties force many parents out of the workforce.</p>
<p>-SNAP asset tests and restrictions risk excluding vulnerable rural families.</p>

<p><strong>Income Inequality (Gini Index)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Rural Counties</strong>:</p>
<p>There is a weak correlation between racial diversity and income inequality. This suggests that in rural areas, increasing racial diversity does not significantly drive disparities in income distribution. Other factors (e.g., employment type, educational access, migration) may play a larger role.</p>
<p><strong>Urban Counties</strong>:</p>
<p>Higher racial diversity is associated with greater income inequality. In urban settings, economic stratification often coincides with racial or ethnic divides, possibly due to systemic inequalities in education, housing, and labor markets.</p>
<p><strong>Health Insurance Coverage</strong></p>
<p>In urban areas, racial diversity is negatively correlated with health insurance coverage. As diversity increases, the percentage of insured individuals tends to decline, potentially reflecting disparities in employment-based insurance access, citizenship status, and enrollment in public programs.</p>

<p><strong>Urban Counties</strong>:</p>
<p>Tend to show higher racial diversity. Exhibit greater income inequality (larger blue points).</p>
<p>Show a wider range of median incomes, including both very low and very high. Diversity and inequality appear positively correlated.</p>
<p><strong>Rural Counties</strong>:</p>
<p>Cluster toward low racial diversity and lower-to-mid median income.</p>
<p>Display a wide range of inequality, but point sizes are generally smaller than urban counterparts.</p>
<p>Diversity has a weaker or no clear association with inequality.</p>
<p><strong>This plot illustrates the triangular tension among</strong>:</p>
<p>Diversity (often associated with opportunity and inclusion)</p>
<p>Income (general prosperity)</p>
<p>Inequality (distribution of prosperity)</p>
<p><strong>In urban areas</strong>:</p>
<p>More diversity attracts both high earners and low-wage workers, increasing polarization. Hence, diversity → income opportunity → inequality.</p>
<p><strong>In rural areas</strong>:</p>
<p>Low diversity and modest incomes dominate. Inequality may arise from access disparities, not demographic heterogeneity.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Data quality</strong> can be a limitation, as some measures may be wonky and different from certain data sources online</li>
<li><strong>Lack of policy-induced changes</strong> analysis only provides current conditions without policy context</li>
<li><strong>Student population effects</strong> may artificially inflate poverty rates in college counties</li>
<li><strong>Geographic aggregation</strong> at county level may mask city variations</li>
<li><strong>Causation vs correlation</strong> - the analysis shows relationships but doesn’t establish causal mechanisms</li>

<li><strong>Time series Analysis</strong>: Track changes over time to identify trends</li>
<li><strong>Spatial Analysis</strong>: Account for geographic effects</li>
<li><strong>Health Integration</strong>: Develop comprehensive models linking health, economics, and geography</li>
<li><strong>Economic types</strong>: Analyze different economic dependencies (e.g., farming, manufacturing, services) to understand their impact on community capitals.</li>
</ol>
<p>This analysis demonstrates that Iowa’s socioeconomic landscape is far more complex than simple rural-urban dichotomies suggest, requiring nuanced approaches to policy and development that recognize each region’s unique characteristics and challenges.</p>

<p>Why It Worked:</p>
<p>Long-term Planning: Cities like Bondurant and Le Mars prepared sewer and road systems years before housing demand peaked.</p>
<p>Proactive Zoning: Pleasant Hill used zoning reforms and tax incentives ( Forge65) to attract developers early.</p>
<p>Design + Growth Balance: Pella and Waverly maintained housing quality through design guidelines and rehab support while allowing infill housing.</p>
<p>Early Broadband Coordination: Sioux Center’s upfront investment in utilities and Harvest Heights(new residential development) helped support strong infrastructure.</p>
<p>## Limitations:</p>
<p>Some cities (like Waverly and Pella) scored well because of maintaining older homes, not because of large-scale new construction.</p>
<p>Le Mars’s “Vision 2045” started late—most of its impact will show up in the next ACS cycle.</p>

<p>Timing: Many projects began in or after 2018—results are just starting to show.</p>
<p>Small Scale: Denison’s 7-unit construction and rehab efforts were limited in scale, preventing full-tier improvement.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="what-they-tried">What They Tried:</h3>
<p>Downtown Revitalization:</p>
<p>Broadband Attempts: Spencer and Mount Pleasant installed fiber before 2018, but take-up was slow.</p>
<p>Sewer Fixes: Oskaloosa and Fairfield invested in sewer systems, improving plumbing indicators.</p>

<section id="why-it-didnt-fully-work" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="why-it-didnt-fully-work">Why It Didn’t Fully Work:</h3>
<p>Localized Improvements: Most projects didn’t reach the full city.</p>
<p>Delayed Rollouts: Fiber reached neighborhoods late or remained unconnected.</p>
<p>Little New Housing: Most cities didn’t add many homes so median year built stayed low.</p>

<section id="limitations-4" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="limitations-4">Limitations:</h3>
<p>Plumbing and broadband improvements didn’t scale.</p>
<p>Most benefits were visible only in central or well-resourced areas. ### Tier 4 – Struggling or Underinvested Cities Fort Madison, Keokuk</p>
</section>
<section id="what-they-did-1" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="what-they-did-1">What They Did:</h3>
<p>Relied on Grants: Both cities used CDBG or state historic preservation grants for small-scale housing rehab.</p>
<p>Maintained Low-Income Units: Fort Madison’s housing authority supported over 100 households with federal assistance.</p>
</section>
<section id="why-they-remain-low-tier" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="why-they-remain-low-tier">Why They Remain Low Tier:</h3>
<p>Minimal New Development: No new large housing projects.</p>
<p>Aging Infrastructure: Water systems and housing stock remained older than average.</p>
<p>Weak Broadband Efforts: Little evidence of citywide or neighborhood fiber investment before 2022.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="limitations-5">Limitations:</h3>
<p>Even with downtown rehabs, systemic issues (like vacant lots, outmigration) outweighed progress.</p>
