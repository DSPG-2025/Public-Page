I’m excited to be a part of this summer’s data science intern cohort and share a bit about myself, my experiences, and my goals. I hope this blog not only introduces who I am but also serves as a reflection of my growth and learning over the course of the program.\n\n\n\nHi! My name is Tanisha Magikar. I’m originally from India and currently an upcoming junior at Iowa State University, majoring in Computer Science with a minor in Data Science. I chose this field because I love solving problems with technology and creating solutions that can positively impact people’s lives. I’m especially passionate about how data can be used to tell stories, make decisions, and drive innovation in everything from healthcare to finance.\n\n\n\nWith my degree, I plan to work in software or data engineering. I want to help build systems that are smart, ethical, and accessible. Data science, to me, is the bridge between raw information and meaningful impact. Whether it’s analyzing protein structures or building recommendation engines, I care about using data responsibly and creatively.\n\n\n\nI’ve been fortunate to gain hands-on experience through multiple avenues. As a backend developer at the Nannovaccine Institute, I worked on a Python-based system to organize and analyze over 1,000 Hydrolase protein properties, my first deep dive into using data science in bioinformatics.\nI’ve also developed full-stack applications, including:\n\nShopTune — a React-based e-commerce platform featuring a built-in music player for an interactive shopping experience. Github\nCYNANCE — an Android finance app that leverages AI to offer personalized budgeting and spending recommendations.Demo\n\nAlongside technical projects, I work as an IT Support Specialist at Iowa State’s College of Liberal Arts and Sciences, helping resolve technical issues for students and faculty. I’ve also served as a Peer Mentor for the Computer Science department and as Multicultural Awareness Director on the Student Union Board, where I led campus-wide initiatives for inclusivity.\n\n \n\n\n\n\nWhen I’m not coding, you’ll find me reading, listening to music, or travelling!\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nI appreciate my curiosity, adaptability, and ability to explain complex concepts clearly.

    "text": "Overview\nHello! My name is Madison Herdlicka and I am from Cedar Rapids, IA. In Fall 2025, I will be a Junior majoring in Community and Regional Planning and minoring in Environmental Studies. I chose my academic career path to help communites and regional networks be inclusive, resillient, and beautiful while also working to protect the environment and reduce city impacts.\n\n\n\nGoals\nPost-graduation, I hope to work as a planner in the public sector for a local government. Tackling affordable housing, climate action, historic preservation, land use, economic health and development, and many other opportunities and problems existing in rural and urban communities.\n\n\nData Science\nData science is a crucial factor in planning to inform decision making. My previous experience with data science has come from courses including Fundamentals of GIS, Intermediate GIS, and Urban Analytical Methods, where I have had to use various datasets to project population, calculate diversity indexes, assess housing affordability, and perform spatial and economic analyses. Without data science, the planning profession would struggle to make informed community policies and plans. Below is a GIS project I worked on in Intermediate GIS, exploring waste management service equity in Linn County, IA.\n\n\n\nGIS Project\n\n\n\n\nHobbies\nOutside academics, I love hanging out with friends, thrifting, traveling, trying new foods, and listening to music. My favorite place I have traveled to is Dublin, Ireland. My most recent travel was to Steamboat Springs, Colorado, for a field travel course, where we met with city and ski resort planners, housing administration, and historic preservation representatives to learn about the city’s housing crisis and other initiatives. My most looked forward to travel is the Spring 2026 study abroad trip to India to study transportation and smart cities.\n\nDublin, Ireland\n\n\nDSPG Goals\nThroughout my time in the DSPG Program, I look forward to expanding my data science skills by contributing to meaningful projects. I am especially excited to learn and apply coding skills for the first time. In relation to data science, I am skilled in using GIS applications, taking my time to create outputs that are done correctly and look nice, and being open and ready to learn as many new things as possible. From the DSPG Program, I would like to learn how to use Tableau to visualize analyzed data and be comfortable using Git and GitHub. The skills I wish to gain from this program will further my ability to use data science in my academic and career path. I plan to improve these skills by learning collaboratively with the other program members and implementing them into our project.\n\n\nConnect With Me!\nLinkedin"

I enjoyed the experience so much that I wanted to rejoin the following summer in 2023 with a couple of additional responsibilities. After sharing my ideas with the Community and Economic Development Extension team, I was lucky to get an assistantship that focused on improving the DSPG program with the responses we’ve received from past participants through our surveys.\nI really enjoy the DSPG program for a multitude of reasons, but here a couple of my favorites.\n\nThe program supports communal and personal learning.\n\nParticipants to the program come from varying levels of education, from first year students to PhD candidates. This usually means that everyone comes in at different skill levels and uses that to either develop the skills that they already know or learn new ones.\n\nProjects are quite varied in their goals and flexible for hands-on learning\n\nDifferent clients expect different results and for a lot of the projects, it is the exploration conducted by students that shapes the final deliverable of the projects.\n\nThe program address real questions by clients interested in learning from data.\n\nThe DSPG projects address complex and real questions about the social world making the application of data science skills extremely practical for real-world scenarios."

In other words, counties in Missouri tend to have higher median salaries as the percentage of residents with a college degree or higher increases.\n\n\nLimitations\n\nCorrelation doesn’t imply Causation\nSimplification of Race\nEstimates (Margin of Error)\nSpatial Limitation (only limited to Missouri)\nMulti-factor problem"

    "text": "Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) education prepares students for future careers and drives national economic growth. It equips students with critical thinking, problem-solving, and technical skills needed in today’s workforce. It plays a central role in fostering innovation, as seen through increased rates of patent filings and startup creation in STEM fields.\nIn Iowa, STEM jobs are among the fastest-growing, with a projected increase of 22%. However, the governor of Iowa has noted that many companies struggle to find qualified workers with the necessary skills. In response, the state has introduced several initiatives to strengthen STEM education. The STEM Scale-Up Program  delivers high-quality materials and professional training to educators across the state. The STEM BEST® Program encourages collaboration between schools and local businesses to provide students with hands-on, real-world learning experiences. The STEM Teacher Externships Program offers teachers opportunities to work in STEM-related industries during the summer, allowing them to integrate practical insights into their classroom instruction.\nDespite the recognized importance of these initiatives, there remains a lack of comprehensive and actionable data on the availability and distribution of STEM resources  within Iowa communities. It is unclear how extensive these resources are and how effectively they can be mobilized to support STEM education development. Additionally, a deeper understanding is needed of the factors influencing students’ decisions to pursue STEM education in Iowa, such as access to local job opportunities, educational infrastructure, participation in science fairs, and extracurricular programs.\n\n\nSeveral US institutions manage different interpretations of STEM for the academy and industry. The US Census uses the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) to classify STEM and non-STEM companies. The Bureau of Labor Statistics uses the Standard Occupational Classification (SOC), whereas the Department of Homeland Security uses the Classification of Instructional Programs (CIP) to determine STEM fields. The National Science Foundation defines two STEM classifications: Science and Engineering and Science (life, physical, social scientists, and engineers) and Engineering-related jobs (health, S&E managers, S&E precollege teachers, technologists, and technicians). The US Census data includes SOC and CIP codes, but other data sources only include one classification type.\n\n\n\n\nWhich STEM education resources already exist in Iowa (both those in active use and those that remain untapped)?\nHow can these resources be effectively mobilized?\nWhat benefits would mobilization deliver, and which STEM-education metrics would it improve?\n\n\n\n\nGrowth Rate of STEM vs non-STEM companies\nIncreased Innovations and Export\nIncome Potential\nProjected Growth\nLower Unemployment Rate\n\n\n\nTo look at how growth rate differs between STEM vs non-STEM companies, we need to ask some questions:\n\nWhat metric can be used to compare growth rate between businesses? Why is this metric better compared to others?\nWhat are some potential datasets that could be used?\nHow do you differentiate STEM vs non-STEM companies?\n\n\n\n\nAimed to compare growth rates between STEM and non-STEM businesses using the Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) metric\n\nCAGR allows for consistent comparison across time periods and smooths out short-term fluctuations to reveal long-term trends\n\nUsed the County Business Patterns (CBP) dataset from the U.S. Census Bureau to find relevant data:\n\nCBP provides annual economic data by industry and state.\n\nIndustries are categorized using NAICS codes, which range from 2 to 6 digits in length (longer codes represent more specific fields).\n\nChose to work with 3-digit NAICS codes, since there are thousands of 4-, 5-, and 6-digit NAICS codes.\nManually classified the 3-digit NAICS codes into STEM and non-STEM categories.\n\nFor each state:\n\nSummed the number of establishments in each category for 2017 and 2022\n\nAn establishment is\n\na single physical location where a business conducts operations or provides services\ndiscrete unit of analysis within a business, distinct from the broader company or enterprise\na sector rather than the whole busines\n\n\nUsed these values to calculate CAGR for both STEM and non-STEM sectors.\ncomputed the CAGR difference using the formula: STEM_CAGR - non-STEM_CAGR\n\nVisualized results in Tableau\n\n                   \n\n\n\n\nThis section breaks into multiple subfactors that contribute to economic impact, including job creation, internet access, exports, wages, and innovation. Each factor provides a lens into how STEM-related activity drives or correlates with regional economic performance.\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: Business Dynamics Statistics (BDS)\n&gt; The BDS tracks annual changes in employment, firm age, and size across industries. For this graph, I used average net job creation for STEM-related sectors in Iowa vs. the U.S. average from approximately 1980 to 2022.\nNet job creation represents the number of jobs created minus those lost — it captures the actual growth in employment. STEM-related sectors reflect industries typically defined by technological and scientific innovation (e.g., high-tech manufacturing, information services, R&D).\n\n\n\n\nVolatility is High for Both Iowa and the U.S. Both lines exhibit sharp year-to-year fluctuations, especially before 2000.\n\nThis may reflect:\nNational economic recessions (e.g., early 1980s, 2001 dot-com crash, 2008 financial crisis).\nSector-specific disruptions (e.g., tech bubbles, automation shifts).\nState-level sensitivity in smaller economies like Iowa.\n\nIowa Lags Behind the U.S. Average in Many Years Especially in the mid-1980s, early 2000s, and early 2010s, Iowa consistently reports lower net job creation than the national average.\nExample: Around 2009–2010, the U.S. starts recovering faster than Iowa post-Great Recession. Implication: Iowa may not benefit from tech recoveries or booms as strongly as national tech hubs.\nIowa Shows Periodic Surges, it occasionally outperforms the national average, e.g., mid-1990s, around 2005, and the most recent spike (2021–2022). The most recent data point shows a sharp positive spike for both Iowa and the U.S., possibly due to post-pandemic recovery.\nSurprising Insight: While Iowa trails in consistency, it is capable of strong rebounds — suggesting that local STEM ecosystems respond well to certain policies or investments.\n\n\n\n\n\nSTEM-related job creation in Iowa is highly variable, with several years of underperformance relative to national averages.\nIowa lacks consistent upward STEM job trends, potentially due to lower STEM density, weaker innovation pipelines, or brain drain.\nDespite this, Iowa occasionally shows strong net job creation spikes, hinting at untapped potential when conditions align (e.g., policy support, infrastructure boosts).\nLong-term economic competitiveness in Iowa may depend on stabilizing and expanding STEM ecosystems, especially in urban centers and through education.\nThe data suggests STEM sectors offer stronger long-term resilience, aligning with national patterns of recovery and innovation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJob classification and STEM definitions may vary across time and sectors.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSTEM jobs make up a small but crucial share of the total workforce, slightly less in Iowa.\nIowa consistently shows a lower proportion of STEM employment than the national average.\nSTEM job share has grown over time in both Iowa and the U.S., but Iowa’s growth is slower.\n\n\n\n\n\nDespite being a small portion of employment, STEM jobs are key drivers of productivity, wages, and innovation.\nIowa’s underrepresentation in STEM jobs suggests untapped potential in sectors like advanced manufacturing, biotech, or information services.\nClosing this gap requires strengthening the STEM pipeline through education, incentives, and digital infrastructure.\n\n\n\n\n\nJob classification and STEM definitions may vary across time and sectors.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: ACS 5-Year Estimates\n\n\n\n\n\nSoutheastern and rural counties in Iowa show internet inaccessibility rates above 25%.\nUrban centers like Des Moines and Ames report better access, with under 15% of households lacking internet.\nA clear urban-rural digital divide exists.\n\n\n\n\n\nLimited internet access in rural counties constrains STEM participation and digital learning.\nSTEM readiness — including access to remote work, online education, and tech entrepreneurship — is directly tied to internet availability.\nInvestments in broadband expansion can reduce regional disparities and boost Iowa’s STEM workforce.\n\n\n\n\n\nSelf-reported internet access may not reflect quality (speed, reliability).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: USA Trade / Export Data\n\n\n\n\nSTEM-intensive exports (e.g., electronics, machinery) dominate high-value trade sectors nationally.\nIowa lags behind states like California and Texas in total STEM export value.\n\n\n\n\n\nSTEM sectors are critical for international competitiveness and economic diversification.\nIowa’s lower share of STEM exports reflects under-leveraged potential in advanced manufacturing and R&D.\nPolicies that support STEM startups, trade incentives, and global partnerships can help Iowa scale its innovation economy.\n\n\n\n\n\nExport data may aggregate STEM and non-STEM subcategories within the same product classification.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: USPTO, Milken Institute, NSF Innovation Index\n\nWe have not yet explored this dataset in detail, as it is in a different file format and requires additional time to process and clean. This is a potential area for future analysis, especially as we investigate the relationship between STEM workforce development and innovation outcomes in Iowa.\n\n\n\n\nPatent filings are often used as a proxy for regional innovation and long-term economic competitiveness.\nStates with higher patent activity tend to have stronger STEM employment bases and higher GDP per capita.\nExploring Iowa’s patent trends can reveal gaps or strengths in its research ecosystem, commercialization, and high-tech entrepreneurship.\n\n\n\n\n\nConvert and process the USPTO/Milken data for state- and MSA-level comparison.\nExplore correlations between patent filings, university research activity, and business startups in Iowa.\nVisualize trends in patent types (e.g., biotech, software, mechanical) to better understand Iowa’s innovation landscape.\n\n\n\n\nTried to verify whether the projected job growth rate (for STEM and non-STEM) in Iowa is similar to that in the USA.

The US Census uses the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) to classify STEM and non-STEM companies. The Bureau of Labor Statistics uses the Standard Occupational Classification (SOC), whereas the Department of Homeland Security uses the Classification of Instructional Programs (CIP) to determine STEM fields. The National Science Foundation defines two STEM classifications: Science and Engineering and Science (life, physical, social scientists, and engineers) and Engineering-related jobs (health, S&E managers, S&E precollege teachers, technologists, and technicians).

    "text": "Which STEM education resources already exist in Iowa (both those in active use and those that remain untapped)?\nHow can these resources be effectively mobilized?\nWhat benefits would mobilization deliver, and which STEM-education metrics would it improve?\n\n\n\n\nGrowth Rate of STEM vs non-STEM companies\nIncreased Innovations and Export\nIncome Potential\nProjected Growth\nLower Unemployment Rate\n\n\n\nTo look at how growth rate differs between STEM vs non-STEM companies, we need to ask some questions:\n\nWhat metric can be used to compare growth rate between businesses? Why is this metric better compared to others?\nWhat are some potential datasets that could be used?\nHow do you differentiate STEM vs non-STEM companies?\n\n\n\n\nAimed to compare growth rates between STEM and non-STEM businesses using the Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) metric\n\nCAGR allows for consistent comparison across time periods and smooths out short-term fluctuations to reveal long-term trends\n\nUsed the County Business Patterns (CBP) dataset from the U.S. Census Bureau to find relevant data:\n\nCBP provides annual economic data by industry and state.\n\nIndustries are categorized using NAICS codes, which range from 2 to 6 digits in length (longer codes represent more specific fields).\n\nChose to work with 3-digit NAICS codes, since there are thousands of 4-, 5-, and 6-digit NAICS codes.\nManually classified the 3-digit NAICS codes into STEM and non-STEM categories.\n\nFor each state:\n\nSummed the number of establishments in each category for 2017 and 2022\n\nAn establishment is\n\na single physical location where a business conducts operations or provides services\ndiscrete unit of analysis within a business, distinct from the broader company or enterprise\na sector rather than the whole busines\n\n\nUsed these values to calculate CAGR for both STEM and non-STEM sectors.\ncomputed the CAGR difference using the formula: STEM_CAGR - non-STEM_CAGR\n\nVisualized results in Tableau\n\n                   \n\n\n\n\nThis section breaks into multiple subfactors that contribute to economic impact, including job creation, internet access, exports, wages, and innovation. Each factor provides a lens into how STEM-related activity drives or correlates with regional economic performance.\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: Business Dynamics Statistics (BDS)\n&gt; The BDS tracks annual changes in employment, firm age, and size across industries. For this graph, I used average net job creation for STEM-related sectors in Iowa vs. the U.S. average from approximately 1980 to 2022.\nNet job creation represents the number of jobs created minus those lost — it captures the actual growth in employment. STEM-related sectors reflect industries typically defined by technological and scientific innovation (e.g., high-tech manufacturing, information services, R&D).\n\n\n\n\nVolatility is High for Both Iowa and the U.S. Both lines exhibit sharp year-to-year fluctuations, especially before 2000.\n\nThis may reflect:\nNational economic recessions (e.g., early 1980s, 2001 dot-com crash, 2008 financial crisis).\nSector-specific disruptions (e.g., tech bubbles, automation shifts).\nState-level sensitivity in smaller economies like Iowa.\n\nIowa Lags Behind the U.S. Average in Many Years Especially in the mid-1980s, early 2000s, and early 2010s, Iowa consistently reports lower net job creation than the national average.\nExample: Around 2009–2010, the U.S. starts recovering faster than Iowa post-Great Recession. Implication: Iowa may not benefit from tech recoveries or booms as strongly as national tech hubs.\nIowa Shows Periodic Surges, it occasionally outperforms the national average, e.g., mid-1990s, around 2005, and the most recent spike (2021–2022). The most recent data point shows a sharp positive spike for both Iowa and the U.S., possibly due to post-pandemic recovery.\nSurprising Insight: While Iowa trails in consistency, it is capable of strong rebounds — suggesting that local STEM ecosystems respond well to certain policies or investments.\n\n\n\n\n\nSTEM-related job creation in Iowa is highly variable, with several years of underperformance relative to national averages.\nIowa lacks consistent upward STEM job trends, potentially due to lower STEM density, weaker innovation pipelines, or brain drain.\nDespite this, Iowa occasionally shows strong net job creation spikes, hinting at untapped potential when conditions align (e.g., policy support, infrastructure boosts).\nLong-term economic competitiveness in Iowa may depend on stabilizing and expanding STEM ecosystems, especially in urban centers and through education.\nThe data suggests STEM sectors offer stronger long-term resilience, aligning with national patterns of recovery and innovation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJob classification and STEM definitions may vary across time and sectors.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSTEM jobs make up a small but crucial share of the total workforce, slightly less in Iowa.\nIowa consistently shows a lower proportion of STEM employment than the national average.\nSTEM job share has grown over time in both Iowa and the U.S., but Iowa’s growth is slower.\n\n\n\n\n\nDespite being a small portion of employment, STEM jobs are key drivers of productivity, wages, and innovation.\nIowa’s underrepresentation in STEM jobs suggests untapped potential in sectors like advanced manufacturing, biotech, or information services.\nClosing this gap requires strengthening the STEM pipeline through education, incentives, and digital infrastructure.\n\n\n\n\n\nJob classification and STEM definitions may vary across time and sectors.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: ACS 5-Year Estimates\n\n\n\n\n\nSoutheastern and rural counties in Iowa show internet inaccessibility rates above 25%.\nUrban centers like Des Moines and Ames report better access, with under 15% of households lacking internet.\nA clear urban-rural digital divide exists.\n\n\n\n\n\nLimited internet access in rural counties constrains STEM participation and digital learning.\nSTEM readiness — including access to remote work, online education, and tech entrepreneurship — is directly tied to internet availability.\nInvestments in broadband expansion can reduce regional disparities and boost Iowa’s STEM workforce.\n\n\n\n\n\nSelf-reported internet access may not reflect quality (speed, reliability).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: USA Trade / Export Data\n\n\n\n\nSTEM-intensive exports (e.g., electronics, machinery) dominate high-value trade sectors nationally.\nIowa lags behind states like California and Texas in total STEM export value.\n\n\n\n\n\nSTEM sectors are critical for international competitiveness and economic diversification.\nIowa’s lower share of STEM exports reflects under-leveraged potential in advanced manufacturing and R&D.\nPolicies that support STEM startups, trade incentives, and global partnerships can help Iowa scale its innovation economy.\n\n\n\n\n\nExport data may aggregate STEM and non-STEM subcategories within the same product classification.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: USPTO, Milken Institute, NSF Innovation Index\n\nWe have not yet explored this dataset in detail, as it is in a different file format and requires additional time to process and clean. This is a potential area for future analysis, especially as we investigate the relationship between STEM workforce development and innovation outcomes in Iowa.\n\n\n\n\nPatent filings are often used as a proxy for regional innovation and long-term economic competitiveness.\nStates with higher patent activity tend to have stronger STEM employment bases and higher GDP per capita.\nExploring Iowa’s patent trends can reveal gaps or strengths in its research ecosystem, commercialization, and high-tech entrepreneurship.\n\n\n\n\n\nConvert and process the USPTO/Milken data for state- and MSA-level comparison.\nExplore correlations between patent filings, university research activity, and business startups in Iowa.\nVisualize trends in patent types (e.g., biotech, software, mechanical) to better understand Iowa’s innovation landscape.\n\n\n\n\nTried to verify whether the projected job growth rate (for STEM and non-STEM) in Iowa is similar to that in the USA.

(STEM attrition is the phenomenon of having a STEM degree but not working in a STEM-related job)\n\nI used the ACS Public Use Microdata Sample PUMS from 2018-2023. The data includes information at household and individual levels. Because the PUMS works with small samples, it includes weights, which represent an estimate of how many more houses or individuals have a similar profile to an individual or house.\n\n\n   State  E..STEM   U.STEM E.non.STEM U.non_STEM Attrition\n1     AL 98.41559 1.584409   94.85019   5.149811  47.88638\n2     AK 97.03781 2.962190   93.34577   6.654232  49.22697\n3     AZ 97.78672 2.213278   95.21814   4.781860  52.26592\n4     AR 97.81824 2.181763   95.33842   4.661576  52.05974\n5     CA 97.01754 2.982463   93.75954   6.240457  54.47601\n6     CO 97.93726 2.062742   95.72337   4.276632  53.26825\n7     CT 97.87894 2.121060   94.68780   5.312196  59.03773\n8     DE 98.81406 1.185943   96.37308   3.626922  52.43343\n9     FL 97.80463 2.195369   95.37276   4.627245  57.21248\n10    GA 96.97682 3.023176   95.15805   4.841947  56.41471\n11    HI 98.30026 1.699738   95.83610   4.163904  57.12147\n12    ID 97.57258 2.427420   96.02849   3.971514  52.75271\n13    IL 97.63993 2.360073   94.49121   5.508792  55.43324\n14    IN 97.95426 2.045735   95.90662   4.093381  50.23875\n15    IA 98.97772 1.022281   96.47431   3.525690  49.52900\n16    KS 98.53966 1.460338   96.42617   3.573835  48.82246\n17    KY 97.89926 2.100736   95.15634   4.843662  52.31713\n18    LA 97.47979 2.520206   94.28579   5.714209  51.56982\n19    ME 98.34706 1.652939   96.32404   3.675956  56.33953\n20    MD 98.01529 1.984715   95.33236   4.667640  52.99596\n21    MA 97.89854 2.101457   95.30006   4.699936  54.76500\n22    MI 97.53862 2.461375   94.91830   5.081703  48.89660\n23    MN 98.48507 1.514928   96.60431   3.395695  50.56589\n24    MS 98.20841 1.791586   94.49741   5.502593  53.09195\n25    MO 98.19492 1.805079   96.10808   3.891920  50.46463\n26    MT 98.46485 1.535148   97.21607   2.783928  50.64775\n27    NE 98.42993 1.570071   97.06072   2.939279  51.21786\n28    NV 97.25742 2.742580   95.22587   4.774129  59.20632\n29    NH 98.94960 1.050399   96.96075   3.039245  51.88649\n30    NJ 97.25210 2.747905   94.64994   5.350064  56.50330\n31    NM 97.31227 2.687726   94.50548   5.494515  52.66826\n32    NY 97.31806 2.681942   94.40359   5.596415  59.96069\n33    NC 98.09467 1.905332   95.30025   4.699748  54.63684\n34    ND 99.03849 0.961513   96.62166   3.378341  45.89868\n35    OH 97.91931 2.080694   95.43552   4.564475  50.71454\n36    OK 98.01371 1.986294   94.54084   5.459163  54.13172\n37    OR 97.65737 2.342630   95.22110   4.778898  52.79438\n38    PA 97.69208 2.307924   95.01686   4.983139  52.23844\n39    RI 97.98524 2.014760   94.25876   5.741244  57.20547\n40    SC 97.38790 2.612103   95.19227   4.807734  57.34833\n41    SD 99.27201 0.727991   97.10805   2.891950  50.54470\n42    TN 97.25113 2.748874   95.55720   4.442799  53.24960\n43    TX 97.56805 2.431946   95.07543   4.924574  54.28080\n44    UT 98.28599 1.714013   96.09426   3.905739  51.59779\n45    VT 98.10395 1.896053   96.86131   3.138688  61.66413\n46    VA 97.63052 2.369478   95.84741   4.152593  56.09813\n47    WA 97.52403 2.475965   94.84708   5.152922  48.71500\n48    WV 97.52579 2.474208   94.76590   5.234099  48.70070\n49    WI 98.67023 1.329768   96.83365   3.166355  50.47330\n50    WY 98.98961 1.010393   95.72199   4.278014  56.03572\n51    DC 97.67286 2.327142   93.73286   6.267139  70.02844\n\n\nInsights:\n\nIowa is in 4th place in STEM employment\nIowa is in the 4th place in the lowest STEM unemployment percentages\nIowa STEM attrition is 49.5%, which could represent an untapped population that could be ready to work on STEM opportunities"

Cleaning and filtering the data gives us the following information:\n- 158 schools went from Acceptable to Needs Improvement or Priority\n- 81 schools went from Commendable to Needs Improvement or Priority\n- 4 schools went from High Performing to Needs Improvement or Priority\n- 1 school went from Exceptional to Needs Improvement or Priority\n\nSchools that were on the borderline of needing help or had average index scores tended to transition the most\nSchools that perform well, tend to stay at the top\nThis might highlight the need for early support and intervention for schools in the middle performance range since those are the schools transitioning the most\nUsing this information can also help us figure out which schools to focus on when looking at our STEM data"

A couple of things to remember with linking images.\n\nPlace your images in the imgs directory. This helps prevent clutter and makes it easier to find the files.\nName your images explicitly. Don’t call them \"image_1.jpg\" but instead something like \"age_scatterplot_1\".\nDon’t save file names with any spaces. Add an _ or use camelCaseNaming. Spaces will prevent the blog from properly rendering!\nMake sure you follow copyright guidelines on images. Don’t add images you would not be permitted to share in any professional environment."

    "section": "Running Code",
    "text": "Running Code\n\nCode Chunks\nOne of the coolest features of the Quarto blogs is the ability to integrate code chunks and have them render. Let’s check out how this works. Here is an example of what a code chunk looks like in the source code.\n\nprint(\"I would like for this text to print.\")\n\n[1] \"I would like for this text to print.\"\n\n\nUsing different markdown arguments, we can customize our code chunks to prevent them from running, displaying, or rendering messages. You can check out some of those options through the R Markdown Reference Guide.\nSome useful ones are below.\neval=TRUE      # If FALSE, knitr will not run the code in the code chunk.\ninclude=TRUE   # If FALSE, knitr will run the chunk but not include the chunk in the final document.\necho=TRUE      # If FALSE, knitr will not display the code in the code chunk above it’s results in the final document.\nmessage=TRUE   # If FALSE, knitr will not display any messages generated by the code.\nwarning=TRUE   # If FALSE, knitr will not display any warning messages generated by the code\n\n\nUsing Data\nMost of the time, you’ll want to run some code that generates a table or a visual of your data. To do this, quarto will need a local reference to your data and that’s why your blogs also come with a directory labelled data\\. If you are working within R, it is advisable to use the .RDS format for saving any data you want to use for displaying code. Let’s look at an example.\n\n# Let's create a data frame to use\n\n## Generate pay grades as factors\nGrades &lt;- c(\"Grade A\", \"Grade B\", \"Grade C\", \"Grade D\", \"Grade E\")\nGrades_Factor &lt;- factor(Grades, levels = c(\"Grade A\", \"Grade B\", \"Grade C\", \"Grade D\", \"Grade E\"))\n\n# Create randomized vectors of size 50\nGender &lt;- sample(x = c(\"Woman\", \"Man\", \"Transgender\", \"Non-binary/non-conforming\", \"Prefer not to respond\"), size=50, replace = TRUE)\nID &lt;- sample(x = 1000:3000, size=50)\nPay &lt;- sample(x = Grades_Factor, size=50, replace=TRUE)\n\n# Create data frame\ndf &lt;- data.frame(Gender, ID, Pay)\n\nIn our example here we’ve created the data in our blog environment, but often this will not be the case. We are going to pretend that our data is stored in the data directory. We will first save the data we created.\n\n# Saving our dataset\nsaveRDS(df, file = \"data/PayData.RDS\")\n\nNow we can load it in as Pay_DF.\n\nPay_DF &lt;- readRDS(\"data/PayData.RDS\")\n\nLet’s write some code with ggplot2 to create a visual.\n\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\npay_colors &lt;- c(\"Grade A\" = \"#1f78b4\", \"Grade B\" = \"#33a02c\", \"Grade C\" = \"#e31a1c\", \"Grade D\" = \"#ff7f00\", \"Grade E\" = \"#6a3d9a\")\n\nggplot(Pay_DF, aes(x = Gender, fill = Pay)) +\n  geom_bar() +\n  labs(x = \"Gender\", y = \"Count\", title = \"Distribution of Pay Grades Across Genders\") +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = pay_colors) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  coord_flip()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nData Guidelines\nHere are some important things to consider when you’re using data sets in your blogs.\n\nVERY IMPORTANT: All data saved in the data directory is publicly visible. Don’t share data that is private into your blogs.\nBe mindful of the size of your data. The larger the data, the longer it will take to render. GitHub also limits commit sizes so keep this in mind."

When you’ve created a code chunk, you will want to switch the section that is typically in the form of {r} to {python} or whatever other supported language you wish to use.\nHere is a Python code block.\n\nimport platform\n\nprint(\"This code is run using python version\", platform.python_version())\n\nThis code is run using python version 3.13.1"

    "section": "Geographical Impacts on Capitals",
    "text": "Geographical Impacts on Capitals\n\nRural Urban Continuum\nThe graph below on the left shows differences in capitals between Urban and Rural counties based on the rural urban continuum. There are 22 counties classified as Urban based on a (1-3) code and 77 counties classified as Rural based on a (4-9) code. The graph below on the right shows differences in capitals between Metropolitan, Micropolitan, and Non-Metropolitan counties based on a different slicing of the rural urban continuum. There are 22 Metropolitan counties (1-3) code, 16 Micropolitan (4-7) code, and 61 Non-Metropolitan (8-9) code.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterpretation: Urban counties do better in Built, Financial, Human, and Political capitals. Rural counties do better in Cultural, Natural, and Social capitals. Metropolitan counties do the best in the same capitals as Urban counties. Non-metropolitan counties do the best in the same capitals as Rural. Micropolitan does not do the best in any capital, but places in the middle for all capitals except Social where they place last. Although the differences between the overall capital scores between counties using the rural urban continuum are not huge, many specific variables within each capital face large differences between classifications.\n\n\nUrban/ Metropolitan strengths:\n\nHousehold Incomes, Property Values\nBachelor and Highschool Degrees/ Diplomas\nInsurance and Broadband Rates\n\n\n\n\nRural/ Nonmetropolitan strengths:\n\nCancer Risk, Particulate Matter, Respitory Hazards\nRates of School Violence\nSupport Ratio\n\n\n\n\n\nEconomic Dependence\nThe graph below shows all capitals by ERS Typology, which gives each county a category of economic dependence. Iowa counties fit into the following categories: Farm-Dependent, Federal/ State Government-Dependent, Manufacturing-Dependent, Non-Specialized, Recreation-Dependent. The second graph shows how far a capital score is from the median of all counties.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterpretation: Recreation performs the highest in all capitals except Social where it performs last. Federal/state government sticks out with high political and human capital. All other economic dependency categories stay relatively flat across capitals. While non-specialized, farm-dependent, and manufacturing-dependent all hold 25-40 counties each, recreation-dependent holds only one county and federal/state government-dependent holds only three counties. This is not a fair comparison as recreation-dependent and federal/state government-dependent are highly sensitive to local conditions/ outliers in their average values, but this does give us an opportunity to expolore these counties as outliers.\n\n\nCombined Statistical Areas (CSA)\nThere are seven CSA’s that select Iowa counties are apart of.\nCSA means Combined Statistical Area. It’s a group of nearby cities and towns that are connected because many people live in one place and work in another nearby place. The government groups these places together to study how people live, work, and move around in a region.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterpretation: There are significant differences in capital scores across CSA’s. From this we can identify outliers of extreme high and low scores. The Spencer-Spirit Lake, IA CSA sticks out as high in Human and Political capitals. The Burlington-Fort Madison, IA-IL CSA, sticks out low in Built and Financial capitals, but performs high in Cultural and Natural capitals.\n\n\nCity Influence on CSA Scores\n\nSpencer-Spirit Lake, IA CSA\nThe graph below shows Human and Political capital scores (capitals of extreme high scores) in the cities contained in the Spencer-Spirit Lake, IA CSA, seperated by county.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterpretation: Cities in Clay County may not contribute to the high CSA totals as much as those in Dickinson County. Cities in Dickinson County boast high, above-median human and political capital scores, except the city of Orleans, which scores below the median in both capitals. The city of Lake Park also scores below the median in political capital.These underperforming cities can weaken the CSA’s overall results, masking the full potential of its collective strengths.\n\n\nBurlington-Fort Madison, IA-IL CSA\nThe graph below shows Built and Financial capital scores (capitals of extreme low scores) in the cities contained in the Burlington-Fort Madison, IA-IL CSA, seperated by county.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterpretation: Most cities in both Lee and Des Moines counties contribute to the low built and financial capital scores seen in the overall CSA, with all city scores in both capitals being below the median in Lee County. Des Moines County holds two above-median cities in the financial capital, Danville and Mediapolis, and one city above the median in the built capital with West Burlington."

It looks at things like volunteering, participation in civic groups, and census response rates.\nWhy it matters: Civic strength reflects a sense of belonging, trust, and willingness to work together for the common good.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSelect County\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInfrastructure Strength Score\nWhat it shows: This score covers the quality of basic physical and digital infrastructure, including broadband access, plumbing, housing age, commute times, and home values.\nWhy it matters: Better infrastructure supports healthy living, access to jobs, and future development.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSelect County\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStability Strength Score\nWhat it shows: This score measures family and social stability. It looks at housing occupancy, family structure (like single-parent rates), age balance, support networks, and racial diversity.\nWhy it matters: More stable communities tend to be safer, more resilient, and better able to support children and older adults.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSelect County\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCounty Specific Strength Score Chart\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSelect County\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy Population Might Influence Performance\nLarge Counties (e.g., Dallas, Johnson):\n\nMore infrastructure and economic diversity\nStronger in GDP, broadband, and education\nWeaker in civic and stability due to population turnover\n\nSmaller Counties (e.g., Sioux, Madison, Bremer):\n\nStronger community ties and civic engagement\nLower unemployment and better insurance coverage\nSuccess often driven by close-knit, stable populations\n\nConclusion: Population size doesn’t define success but it shapes how counties are strong. Big counties lead in infrastructure; smaller ones shine in civic life and stability. These counties highlight what strong or struggling performance looks like.\n\n\nVariable Comparison Chart\nEach strength score (like Human or Economic) is made up of several variables. This chart helps you see which specific variables are helping or hurting a county’s overall strength.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSelect County\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSelect Metric\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter looking at the strength scores across counties, we wanted to dig deeper. Do things like broadband access or long commutes help explain why some counties score higher or lower?\n\n\n\nIf broadband access improves, will there be measurable gains in school violence, economic connectedness, or volunteering rates?\n\nBroadband vs School Violence\nInterpretation: The graph indicates a slight upward trend, suggesting a weak positive relationship between broadband access and school violence rate. The wide confidence interval especially at the lower and higher ends of broadband percentages shows significant variability and uncertainty in the estimate, likely due to outliers and fewer observations in those ranges.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBroadband vs Economic Connectedness\nInterpretation: This graph suggests a positive relationship between broadband access and economic connectedness. Counties with more broadband access tend to be more economically connected. While there’s still some variation in the data, we can say that broadband access may help improve economic opportunities and networks in a community.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBroadband vs Volunteering\nInterpretation: This graph shows a slight negative relationship between broadband access and volunteering. In simple terms, counties with higher broadband access tend to have slightly lower volunteering rates. However, the relationship is weak, and there is a lot of scatter in the data. This suggests that while there might be a small downward trend, other factors likely play a bigger role in whether people volunteer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCould shorter commutes help people get more involved locally?\n\nLong Commutes vs Volunteering\nInterpretation: This graph shows a very slight positive relationship between long commutes and volunteering. However, the trend is weak, and there’s a lot of variation in the data. This suggests that commute time may not have a strong effect on whether people volunteer, and other factors likely matter more."

Variables with excessive missing values were dropped to maintain data quality.\nVariable Selection & Scaling:\nWe picked indicators from four areas:\n\nFinancial Capital (income, jobs)\nNatural Capital (farmland, environment)\nBuilt Capital (housing, internet)\nHuman Capital (education, health)\n\\[\nz = \\frac{x - \\mu}{\\sigma}\n\\]\nwhere (x) is the original value, () is the mean, and () is the standard deviation.\n\nMeasuring Similarity Using Euclidean Distance:\nWe used Euclidean distance to calculate how similar counties are based on all variables,This helps us group counties with similar patterns of strength or weakness.\n\n\\[\nd(\\mathbf{x}, \\mathbf{y}) = \\sqrt{\\sum_{i=1}^n (x_i - y_i)^2}\n\\]\nwhere () and () are county vectors across all variables.\n\nClustering:\nWe applied hierarchical clustering using Ward’s method to counties that had complete data. This method puts counties into groups (or “clusters”) based on their overall similarity. 11 distinct clusters of similar counties.\nAssigning Counties with Missing Data:\nCounties missing data were assigned to clusters by matching available variables to the closest cluster centroid.\nMissing Data Imputation:\nSome counties were missing a few values. We handled this in two steps:\n\nFirst, we matched them to the closest cluster using the data they did have.\nThen, we filled in missing values using the average value from that cluster:\n\\[\nx_{ij}^{\\text{imputed}} = \\bar{x}_{.j}^{(c)}\n\\]\nwhere (x_{ij}^{}) is the imputed value for county (i), variable (j), and ({x}_{.j}^{(c)}) is the cluster (c) mean for variable (j).\n\nFinal Clustering:\nAfter imputation and re-standardization, clustering was rerun to finalize groups.\nModel Building:\nFor clusters with enough counties, we built linear Regression model to see what factors explain the differences in financial, natural, built, and human capital.\n\nWe used:\nR² to check how much the model explains.\nAdjusted R² to see if the model is actually reliable.\nIf Adjusted R² was high, the model worked well. If it was low or negative, the model didn’t explain much."

Access to infrastructure was assessed by calculating the rate of internet and plumbing access in each area, with corresponding standardized scores. Commuting patterns were captured by first summing all time intervals to get total commuters, then calculating the share of commuters for each time bracket (e.g., less than 5 minutes, 10–14 minutes, etc.), and finally standardizing those proportions. Altogether, these metrics were transformed into z-scores to enable direct comparisons across different domains of well-being and infrastructure.\n\nHigher education and income are generally linked to shorter commutes, higher internet scores, and better housing/plumbing.

However, the dots are widely scattered, and the trend is quite weak.

As income increases, the percentage of residents with a college degree also tends to rise. The trend is much clearer and more consistent compared to other relationships, suggesting that higher income levels are closely associated with higher educational attainment across counties. This may reflect the role of wealth in expanding access to higher education or the economic advantages held by more educated populations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnalysis of Human, Financial, and Social Capital Across Counties\nThis chart compares three types of capital Human, Financial, and Social for a selected county using standardized scores.

However, further investigation would be needed to determine causality."

Besides recreation and federal/state government-dependent, averages do not deviate significantly from the median.\n\n\nLimitations\nWhile non-specialized, farm-dependent, and manufacturing-dependent all hold 25-40 counties each, recreation-dependent holds only one county and federal/state government-dependent holds only three counties. This is not a fair comparison as recreation-dependent and federal/state government-dependent are highly sensitive to local conditions/ outliers in their average values. Again, results do not give us significant differences between economic dependence types, as averages across those with enough counties to compare are very simaler when using all variables under each capital."

These residents may work urban jobs with higher wages, pushing up median income. Meanwhile, others in the same areas may work locally for much lower wages or be unemployed, inflating poverty rates.\nEffect:\n-Raises median income via urban-connected earners\n-Raises poverty rate via local non-earners or underemployed\n-Keeps inequality low because incomes are not as extreme as in cities\nLimited Economic Diversity: Rural areas often lack extreme wealth concentrations found in urban centers. Even if some earn more, income ceilings are lower compared to cities.\nEffect:\n-Inequality appears lower due to narrower income range, despite differences in livelihood quality.\nHousehold Composition & Cost of Living:\n-Larger rural households may have dual-income setups (e.g., both spouses working), pushing up median income.\n-Yet, single-person or elderly households with limited resources remain vulnerable, increasing poverty rates.\n-Lower cost of living can mask hardship in income statistics.\nEffect:\n-Median income looks better -Poverty remains high among vulnerable groups -Overall income spread remains tight → lower Gini coefficient\nCommuting Patterns: Some rural residents commute to higher-paying city jobs (especially near metro fringes).\nThis creates a bimodal population:\n-One group with urban income -Another group with limited local income or unemployment\nEffect:\n-Median income rises due to city-connected earners -Poverty rate high from those without access to such opportunities -Income inequality stays moderate due to few ultra-wealthy\nWhat To Explore Further\n-Commute Time Analysis: Match income and poverty data with average commute times to identify suburban influence in rural stats.\n-Gini Coefficient Maps: Compare inequality within census tracts labeled as rural to detect variations.\n-Occupation Types: Identify how remote work or medical/educational professions cluster in rural areas."

    "text": "Why Rural Areas Have More Single Parents\nThis section explores the factors contributing to higher single parenthood rates in rural areas:\n\n\n`geom_smooth()` using formula = 'y ~ x'\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSingle Parent Household Statistics by County Type\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncounty_type\nCounties\nMean_Single_Parent\nMedian_Single_Parent\nSD_Single_Parent\n\n\n\n\nNon-Rural\n22\n0.42\n0.34\n0.28\n\n\nRural\n77\n0.53\n0.51\n0.22\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnderstanding Rural Single Parenthood Patterns\nWhy do rural areas show higher rates of single parenthood?\nPotential Contributing Factors:\n-Economic Constraints: Many rural Iowans face limited employment opportunities, wage stagnation, and underemployment. Financial strain can contribute to relationship breakdowns or discourage formal partnerships like marriage.\n-Out-Migration: Young adults often leave rural Iowa for better educational or career opportunities in urban centers. This reduces the pool of potential partners, weakens community ties, and interrupts long-term relationships.\n-Cultural Factors: Family formation norms vary across rural regions. In some areas, early childbearing, cohabitation without marriage, or single parenting may be more socially accepted or less stigmatized than in urban areas.\n-Service Access: Access to family planning, prenatal care, mental health services, and relationship counseling is limited in many parts of rural Iowa. This contributes to unplanned pregnancies and a lack of support for struggling relationships.\n-Religious and Policy Influences: While rural Iowa communities often hold traditional values, they also tend to support policies that restrict abortion access and comprehensive sex education. Combined with limited reproductive healthcare, this can lead to higher rates of single parenthood following unintended pregnancies.\nSupport Systems and Policy Context in Iowa:\n-Strong Informal Networks: Rural Iowans often benefit from strong extended family and community support after separation. However, these supports cannot fully address the root causes.\n-State Programs: Iowa offers programs like the Family Investment Program (FIP), Parent Partners, Early Head Start, and Medicaid, which help single parents with basic needs, health, and employment training. However, gaps remain:\n-Guaranteed income pilots (e.g., UpLift) have been banned for future expansion.\n-Childcare shortages in rural counties force many parents out of the workforce.\n-SNAP asset tests and restrictions risk excluding vulnerable rural families.\n\n\nRacial Diversity Analysis\n\n\n`geom_smooth()` using formula = 'y ~ x'\n`geom_smooth()` using formula = 'y ~ x'\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnderstanding Race Diversity correlation with socioeconomic indicators\nIncome Inequality (Gini Index)\nRural Counties:\nThere is a weak correlation between racial diversity and income inequality. This suggests that in rural areas, increasing racial diversity does not significantly drive disparities in income distribution. Other factors (e.g., employment type, educational access, migration) may play a larger role.\nUrban Counties:\nHigher racial diversity is associated with greater income inequality. In urban settings, economic stratification often coincides with racial or ethnic divides, possibly due to systemic inequalities in education, housing, and labor markets.\nHealth Insurance Coverage\nIn urban areas, racial diversity is negatively correlated with health insurance coverage. As diversity increases, the percentage of insured individuals tends to decline, potentially reflecting disparities in employment-based insurance access, citizenship status, and enrollment in public programs.\n\n\nThe Diversity-Income-Inequality Triangle\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnderstanding the Diversity-Income-Inequality Triangle\nUrban Counties:\nTend to show higher racial diversity. Exhibit greater income inequality (larger blue points).\nShow a wider range of median incomes, including both very low and very high. Diversity and inequality appear positively correlated.\nRural Counties:\nCluster toward low racial diversity and lower-to-mid median income.\nDisplay a wide range of inequality, but point sizes are generally smaller than urban counterparts.\nDiversity has a weaker or no clear association with inequality.\nThis plot illustrates the triangular tension among:\nDiversity (often associated with opportunity and inclusion)\nIncome (general prosperity)\nInequality (distribution of prosperity)\nIn urban areas:\nMore diversity attracts both high earners and low-wage workers, increasing polarization. Hence, diversity → income opportunity → inequality.\nIn rural areas:\nLow diversity and modest incomes dominate. Inequality may arise from access disparities, not demographic heterogeneity."

It is unclear how extensive these resources are and how effectively they can be mobilized to support STEM education development. Additionally, a deeper understanding is needed of the factors influencing students’ decisions to pursue STEM education in Iowa, such as access to local job opportunities, educational infrastructure, participation in science fairs, and extracurricular programs. This project seeks to address these gaps by developing a centralized, user-friendly data repository along with visualization tools that present clear and contextual information. These resources will serve Iowa’s policymakers, educators, advocates, and community stakeholders by informing strategic decisions, guiding investments, and supporting targeted policy interventions to strengthen STEM education throughout the state.\nProject Sponsor: ISU Community and Economic Development\nProject Advisers: Mohammad Ahnaf Sadat, Chris Seeger\nGraduate Fellows: Jorge Yass\nUndergraduate Scholars: Aparneesh Patil, Ekaterina Kurkalova, Rishita Kollu\nFinal Presentation Video: Final Presentations on July 23rd\n\n\nHealthy Community Capitals\nThe Community Capitals project seeks to explore the relationship between community capital indicators and the overall condition of communities in Iowa, aiming to identify strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and gaps within these communities.

    "text": "Housing affordability has become an increasingly pressing issue across the United States, with Iowa being no exception. As median home values continue to rise, understanding the relationship between household income and housing characteristics is very important.\nThis report examines the correlation between income and housing characteristics in Iowa from 2005 to 2023, spanning nearly two decades of economic changes including the 2008 financial crisis, its recovery, and 2020-2021 COVID Pandemic. By analyzing American Community Survey (ACS) data, we investigate how the percentage of income spent on housing has evolved over time and explore the relationship between personal earnings and housing payments.\nThe analysis focuses on five key research questions:\n\nHow has the percentage of household income spent on housing costs changed in Iowa from 2005 to 2023?\nThe changes in income compared to the median cost of a house\nOwnership vs rent from 2005-2023\nHow do mortgage rates affect house ownership\nHow have major events affected the housing situation in Iowa\n\nUnderstanding these trends is essential for assessing housing affordability and identifying potential policy interventions to support Iowa residents in accessing affordable housing options.\n\n\n\n\nCode\ndf_long &lt;- read.csv(\"data/median_income_house_prices.csv\")\nyears &lt;- c(2005:2019, 2021, 2022, 2023)\n\nggplot(df_long, aes(x = year, y = value, color = variable)) +\n  geom_line(linewidth = 1.2) +\n  geom_point(size = 2) +\n  scale_x_continuous(breaks = years) +\n  scale_y_continuous(labels = comma) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Progression of Median House Prices and Income in Iowa (2005–2023)\",\n    x = \"Year\",\n    y = \"USD\",\n    color = \"Variable\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHousehold income from 2005 to 2023 compared to the median house price has not kept pace with the increase in housing costs. While median household income has grown steadily over this period, median house prices have increased at a much faster rate. This is particularly evident after 2012, where house prices show exponential growth while income growth remains relatively linear. By just looking at this, we can make the \\(H_0\\) that houses are becoming less and less affordable.\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\ndf_housing &lt;- read.csv(\"data/owner_vs_renter_occupied.csv\")\nyears &lt;- c(2005:2019, 2021, 2022, 2023)\n\nggplot(df_housing, aes(x = year)) +\n  geom_line(aes(y = percent_owner_occupied, color = \"Owner Occupied\"), linewidth = 1.2) +\n  geom_line(aes(y = percent_renter_occupied, color = \"Renter Occupied\"), linewidth = 1.2) +\n  scale_x_continuous(breaks = years) +\n  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent_format(scale = 1)) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Percentage of Owner vs Renter Occupied Housing Units in Iowa (2005–2023)\",\n    x = \"Year\",\n    y = \"Percentage\",\n    color = \"Housing Type\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs we can see, the housing ownership rate in Iowa has remained very stable throughout the 2005-2023 period. Despite the 2008 crisis and the COVID-19 pandemic, the percentage of owner-occupied housing units has consistently been around the 70s, while renter-occupied units have been hovering at the mid-to-high 20s. This stability suggests that major economic disruptions had minimal impact on Iowa’s overall housing trend.\nThe trend is further supported by research showing that Iowa has a high percentage of homeownership compared to other Midwest states and the national average, with relatively low housing costs and a low percentage of cost-burdened households (Iowa Finance Authority, n.d.).\nThis would seem to contradict our initial hypothesis (\\(H_0\\)) that houses are becoming less affordable. If housing ownership rates remain stable despite rising prices, what factors might explain this apparent contradiction and the sustained homeownership levels in Iowa?\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nms_3 &lt;- read.csv(\"data/own_or_rent_by_age_2023.csv\")\n\nggplot(ms_3, aes(x = amount, fill = payment_type)) +\n  geom_histogram(position = \"identity\", alpha = 0.5, bins = 30, color = \"black\") +\n  facet_wrap(~ age_group) +\n  scale_x_continuous(labels = scales::comma) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Distribution by Age Group and Housing Type (IA, 2023 ACS 1-Year PUMS)\",\n    x = NULL,\n    y = \"Count\",\n    fill = \"Housing Type\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 2023, it is evident that most people in Iowa own homes rather than rent, even among younger age groups. Ownership rates have hovered around 70% from 2005 to 2023, with little change during both the Great Recession and the COVID pandemic.\n\n\nCode\ndf_long1 &lt;- read.csv(\"data/percent_income_spent_on_mortgage.csv\")\n\nggplot(df_long1, aes(x = year, y = percent_income_spent)) +\n  geom_line(linewidth = 1.2) +\n  geom_point(size = 2) +\n  scale_x_continuous(breaks = years) +\n  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent_format(scale = 1)) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Percentage of Income Spent on Mortgage in Iowa (2005–2023)\",\n    x = \"Year\",\n    y = \"Percentage of Income Spent on Mortgage\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs we can see from the data above, it is evident that people are spending less and less of their income on housing over time. This trend suggests that the growth of household income is matching or even exceeding the total cost of owning a home in Iowa. But in the previous sections, it was shown that house prices increased exponentially more than the median household income. This presents a contradiction in our analysis. So what might be the factor that correlates with Iowa’s stable house ownership rate?\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nmortgage_rate &lt;- read.csv(\"data/30-year-fixed-mortgage-rate-chart.csv\", skip = 13)\nmortgage_rate$date &lt;- as.Date(mortgage_rate$date)\n\nplot_ly(mortgage_rate, x = ~date, y = ~value, type = 'scatter', mode = 'lines',\n         name = 'Mortgage Rate', line = list(color = '#1f77b4', width = 2),\n         width = 1300, height = 700) %&gt;% \n  layout(title = list(text = 'National 30-Year Fixed Mortgage Rate (1971-2025)', \n                      font = list(size = 18)),\n         plot_bgcolor = '#f8f9fa',  \n         xaxis = list(  \n           title = 'Year',\n           showgrid = TRUE,\n           gridcolor = '#e0e0e0',\n           zeroline = FALSE),  \n         yaxis = list(  \n           title = 'Rate (%)',\n           showgrid = TRUE,\n           gridcolor = '#e0e0e0',\n           zeroline = FALSE),\n         showlegend = TRUE,\n         hovermode = 'x unified')\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMortgage rates in the United States have experienced significant fluctuations from 1971 to 2025. The 2008 financial crisis led to declines, with rates dropping below 5%.\nFrom 2008 to 2012, while the market itself was recovering, mortgage rates declined significantly, making houses more affordable.\nThere were slight increases between 2013-2019, but overall rates remained very stable.\nHowever, in 2020-2021, due to the COVID pandemic, rates went as low as 2.73% after the Fed cut the federal funds rate to near zero to avoid a pandemic-induced recession (Liang and Wessel 2024).\nBy late 2021, it became clear that, while federal policies had shortened the pandemic recession, they had also overstimulated the economy. Inflation peaked at 9.1 percent in June 2022. The Fed responded by raising its benchmark rate sharply (Ostrowski 2025).\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\ndf &lt;- read.csv(\"data/median_house_prices_midwest_states_and_some_big_states.csv\")\n\nggplot(df, aes(x = year, y = median_house_price)) +\n  geom_line(linewidth = 1.2, color = \"blue\") +\n  geom_point(size = 2, color = \"blue\") +\n  facet_wrap(~ NAME, scales = \"free_y\") +\n  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(2005, 2023, by = 2)) +\n  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::comma) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Median House Prices by State (2005–2023)\",\n    x = \"Year\",\n    y = \"Median House Price (USD)\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLooking at the data, we can observe that larger states like New York, Washington, and Massachusetts exhibit much more dramatic price fluctuations compared to smaller Midwest states. These bigger states show steeper increases during boom periods and more pronounced dips during market corrections, while states like Iowa, North Dakota, South Dakota, and Nebraska maintain relatively steady, linear growth patterns throughout the time period.\n\n\n\nThe housing market crash of 2008-2012, fueled by the subprime mortgage crisis, saw major housing price drops across the US, with some states experiencing more severe declines than others. These price drops were primarily driven by the inability of many homeowners to repay their mortgages, leading to a surge in foreclosures and a glut of homes on the market (Weinberg, n.d.).\n\n\n\nAccording to Capozza et al. (2002), “variation in the cyclical behavior of real house prices across metropolitan areas is due to more than just variation in local economies. House prices react differently to economic shocks depending on such factors as growth rates, area size, and construction costs.”\nIn short, what influences housing prices? Housing supply, population growth, urbanization, regulatory constraints, and interest rates (Steers Global Real Assets 2025).\n\n\nCode\ngdp &lt;- read.csv(\"data/Real_GDP_for_the_State_of_Iowa__Most_Recent_Quarterly_Estimates_20250530.csv\")\n\ngdp$Real.GDP.Billions &lt;- gdp$Real.GDP / 1000000000\n\nggplot(gdp, aes(x = reorder(Industry, Real.GDP), y = Real.GDP.Billions)) +\n  geom_col(fill = \"steelblue\", alpha = 0.7) +\n  coord_flip() +\n  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::comma) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Real GDP by Industry for Iowa (Q2 2024)\",\n    x = \"Industry\",\n    y = \"Real GDP (Billions $)\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    axis.text.y = element_text(size = 9),\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 14, hjust = 0.5)\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom the GDP composition chart, we can see that Iowa relies heavily on manufacturing, agriculture, and other traditional industries that provide economic stability (data.iowa.gov, n.d.). The state’s diversified economy, with significant contributions from manufacturing, finance, and agriculture sectors, creates a more resilient economic foundation that helps maintain steady housing demand without the speculative bubbles seen in tech-heavy or finance-dominated markets.\nIowa has maintained relatively stable housing prices due to several key factors: steady economic growth without dramatic booms or busts, a stable economy, lower regulatory constraints compared to coastal states, and more balanced housing supply. Additionally, Iowa’s smaller metropolitan areas and lower construction costs have contributed to this stability, making the state less susceptible to the extreme price volatility experienced in larger, more speculative housing markets.\n\n\n\nThe analysis shows that household income does not correlate with the rate of homeownership in Iowa, but rather that there are numerous variables in the equation. Despite disproportional growth between household income and house prices, the actual cost of owning a house has decreased significantly since 2005. It is also worth noting that Iowa’s financial growth was not heavily impacted by major financial crises. This is due to its reliance on a more stable manufacturing-based economy as shown in its GDP composition. A significant reason why it is so stable is that housing prices in Iowa are only 3 times the yearly household income, which is one of the lowest ratios in the country. In contrast, in bigger states, despite massive swings, the ratio between housing prices and income remains significantly higher."

These price drops were primarily driven by the inability of many homeowners to repay their mortgages, leading to a surge in foreclosures and a glut of homes on the market (Weinberg, n.d.)."

    "text": "According to Capozza et al. (2002), “variation in the cyclical behavior of real house prices across metropolitan areas is due to more than just variation in local economies. House prices react differently to economic shocks depending on such factors as growth rates, area size, and construction costs.”\nIn short, what influences housing prices? Housing supply, population growth, urbanization, regulatory constraints, and interest rates (Steers Global Real Assets 2025).\n\n\nCode\ngdp &lt;- read.csv(\"data/Real_GDP_for_the_State_of_Iowa__Most_Recent_Quarterly_Estimates_20250530.csv\")\n\ngdp$Real.GDP.Billions &lt;- gdp$Real.GDP / 1000000000\n\nggplot(gdp, aes(x = reorder(Industry, Real.GDP), y = Real.GDP.Billions)) +\n  geom_col(fill = \"steelblue\", alpha = 0.7) +\n  coord_flip() +\n  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::comma) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Real GDP by Industry for Iowa (Q2 2024)\",\n    x = \"Industry\",\n    y = \"Real GDP (Billions $)\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    axis.text.y = element_text(size = 9),\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 14, hjust = 0.5)\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom the GDP composition chart, we can see that Iowa relies heavily on manufacturing, agriculture, and other traditional industries that provide economic stability (data.iowa.gov, n.d.). The state’s diversified economy, with significant contributions from manufacturing, finance, and agriculture sectors, creates a more resilient economic foundation that helps maintain steady housing demand without the speculative bubbles seen in tech-heavy or finance-dominated markets.\nIowa has maintained relatively stable housing prices due to several key factors: steady economic growth without dramatic booms or busts, a stable economy, lower regulatory constraints compared to coastal states, and more balanced housing supply. Additionally, Iowa’s smaller metropolitan areas and lower construction costs have contributed to this stability, making the state less susceptible to the extreme price volatility experienced in larger, more speculative housing markets."

    "text": "The analysis shows that household income does not correlate with the rate of homeownership in Iowa, but rather that there are numerous variables in the equation. Despite disproportional growth between household income and house prices, the actual cost of owning a house has decreased significantly since 2005. It is also worth noting that Iowa’s financial growth was not heavily impacted by major financial crises. This is due to its reliance on a more stable manufacturing-based economy as shown in its GDP composition. A significant reason why it is so stable is that housing prices in Iowa are only 3 times the yearly household income, which is one of the lowest ratios in the country. In contrast, in bigger states, despite massive swings, the ratio between housing prices and income remains significantly higher."

I am from Guatemala and was born in a beautiful small city called Antigua Guatemala:\n\n\n\nPicture by Chad Davis - https://www.flickr.com/photos/146321178@N05/49640785242/\n\n\nBefore coming to the US, I worked for 9 years as a software engineer at a financial institution, where I worked mainly with relational databases and C#. My background is in Information Systems and Cybersecurity.\n\nAcademic year and degree\nI am about to start my fourth year in a PhD in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) and a co-major in Computer Engineering. My current research is about exploring students’ mental models of the Internet to identify misconceptions, to inform the design/implementation of video games to teach cybersecurity concepts.\nI chose my major because of the experiences I had as a software engineer. I realize that even when we met the functional requirements a client required, sometimes the client was unhappy or demotivated to use the software we built, and that is because our team focused on the technical specifications and not the most critical element of a system: the person.\n\n\nMy future plans\nI plan to return to my country and start a company focused on UX research! I also want to join the Academy.\n\n\nWhy I care about data science\nData Science is important because it supports the decision-making process. During my previous job, I noticed the importance of data and how it can be used to predict or classify things.\n\n\nPrevious experience in Data Science\n\nIn my previous job, I created a flow to extract information from SonnarQube, a static code vulnerability analysis tool. I took the analysis into a database and made a dashboard in PowerBI that my boss used to see our team’s top 10 vulnerabilities when coding. That helped us to look for specific training.\nI also worked on a project where I used a web-scrapping tool and created a linear model to predict the value of some assets based on the information collected from the web.\n\n\n\nFun facts\nI have two dogs, Franky and Bruno.\n\n\n\nPicture by me\n\n\nThis is Bruno coding in R Studio:\n\n\n\nPicture by me\n\n\nI also spend a lot of time playing chess (if you play chess, find me on Chess.com as JYassGt), playing video games, and reading.\n\n\nMy skills\nI can quickly learn new technical stuff, integrate data from many sources, and clean it.\n\n\nThe skills I want to learn\n\nGoing deep into my Python skills.\nLearn about using geographic visualization tools.\nLearn to use ArcGIS\n\nMastering Python skills is important for this project and my research, where I experiment with LLMs’ APIs. I also recognize maps’ value in presenting information and want to add to my tools arsenal.\nI hope to achieve my skill goals by a hands-on approach trough these 9 weeks."

I was particularly intrigued by data science as a tool in government. Passionate about helping the government make informed decisions and helping people, I chose to pursue DS!\n\nWhy Russian Studies?\nInitially, I never planned to take Russian course at ISU. After trying out the film studies class as an elective I decided to pursue a minor in Russian studies. It would help me connect to my culture and hone my language skills. More than that, Russian is a critical language with importance in global affairs. As someone who wants to work in the government, knowing the language and culture of a politically significant nation felt natural."

    "text": "Overview\nThis census report examines various socioeconomic factors for census tracts within Polk and Linn County, Iowa. Through the use of scatterplots, static maps, and interactive maps, we can explore correlations between variables and better understand local challenges. This report utilizes the American Community Survey (ACS) 2021 5-Year Estimates, with a focus on analyzing:\n\n“B17001_002” : Population below the poverty line\n“B08201_002” : Households without access to a vehicle\n“B23025_005” : Unemployment rates\n\n\n\nPoverty by Census Tract\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe poverty maps above show percentage of the population in poverty across census tracts in Polk and Linn counties. The maps reveal a clear concentration of poverty in relation to the urban cores of Cedar Rapids and Des Moines. Yet, Des Moines’ distribution of high poverty areas is a little more dispersed across the metropolitan area than Cedar Rapids. The gray tract in the Polk County map represents an airport tract with a population of zero.\n\n\nPoverty and Vehicle Access\n\nLinn County\n\n\n\n\nPolk County\n\n\nThe interactive poverty and vehicle access maps above show poverty percentages by census tract, with green circles sized according to the number of households without vehicle access, revealing relationships between the two. Both maps show strong overlaps of high poverty and low vehicle access. Low vehicle access in Polk County is much more dispersed than in Linn County, with large dots reaching much farther than just the tracts near Des Moines’ urban core. By tapping on a tract or green dot, a pop up appears with the percent of people in poverty or the number of households without a vehicle in the corresponding tract.\n\nThe scatterplot above shows households without a vehicle on the x-axis and people in poverty on the y-axis to explore correlations between the two variables. Each dot represents a single census tract. The purple line and dots represent Polk County and the orange line and dots represent Linn County. The trend line indicates a positive correlation in both counties, showing as the number of people in poverty increases, so does the amount of households without a vehicle.\n\n\n\nUnemployment Rate by Census Tract\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe unemployment maps above show percentage of unemployment across census tracts in Linn and Polk counties. The maps reveal a clear concentration of unemployment in tracts near and around the urban cores of Cedar Rapids and Des Moines. Polk County shows a much larger amount of tracts of high unemployment than Linn County. The bottom gray census tract in the Polk County map represents an airport tract with no data, the two other gray tracts had too high of unemployment to be shown in comparison with Linn County while keeping a plausible scale.\n\n\nUnemployment and Poverty\n\nThe scatterplot above shows unemployment on the x-axis and poverty on the y-axis to explore correlations between the two variables. Each dot represents a single census tract. The purple line and dots represent Polk County and the orange line and dots represent Linn County. The trend line indicates a positive correlation in both counties, showing as poverty increases, so does unemployment and vice versa."

For instance, a person might be covered by both employer-based insurance and Medicare.\nKey findings include:\nEmployer-based insurance is the most common type of coverage for both males and females, reflecting its central role in the U.S. healthcare system.\nMedicare and Medicaid follow, with slightly higher Medicaid coverage among females, likely due to eligibility related to caregiving roles and pregnancy.\nTRICARE and VA coverage are more popular among males, reflecting the gender distribution in military service.\nDirect purchase insurance shows relatively equal distribution, though this market typically includes self-employed individuals and those without employer-sponsored options.\nThese patterns show how insurance access pathways vary by sex and are shaped by employment, age, veteran status, and caregiving responsibilities."
