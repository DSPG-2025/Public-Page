I’m excited to be a part of this summer’s data science intern cohort and share a bit about myself, my experiences, and my goals. I hope this blog not only introduces who I am but also serves as a reflection of my growth and learning over the course of the program.\n\n\n\nHi! My name is Tanisha Magikar. I’m originally from India and currently an upcoming junior at Iowa State University, majoring in Computer Science with a minor in Data Science. I chose this field because I love solving problems with technology and creating solutions that can positively impact people’s lives. I’m especially passionate about how data can be used to tell stories, make decisions, and drive innovation in everything from healthcare to finance.\n\n\n\nWith my degree, I plan to work in software or data engineering. I want to help build systems that are smart, ethical, and accessible. Data science, to me, is the bridge between raw information and meaningful impact. Whether it’s analyzing protein structures or building recommendation engines, I care about using data responsibly and creatively.\n\n\n\nI’ve been fortunate to gain hands-on experience through multiple avenues. As a backend developer at the Nannovaccine Institute, I worked on a Python-based system to organize and analyze over 1,000 Hydrolase protein properties, my first deep dive into using data science in bioinformatics.\nI’ve also developed full-stack applications, including:\n\nShopTune — a React-based e-commerce platform featuring a built-in music player for an interactive shopping experience. Github\nCYNANCE — an Android finance app that leverages AI to offer personalized budgeting and spending recommendations.Demo\n\nAlongside technical projects, I work as an IT Support Specialist at Iowa State’s College of Liberal Arts and Sciences, helping resolve technical issues for students and faculty. I’ve also served as a Peer Mentor for the Computer Science department and as Multicultural Awareness Director on the Student Union Board, where I led campus-wide initiatives for inclusivity.\n\n \n\n\n\n\nWhen I’m not coding, you’ll find me reading, listening to music, or travelling!\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nI appreciate my curiosity, adaptability, and ability to explain complex concepts clearly.

    "text": "Overview\nHello! My name is Madison Herdlicka and I am from Cedar Rapids, IA. In Fall 2025, I will be a Junior majoring in Community and Regional Planning and minoring in Environmental Studies. I chose my academic career path to help communites and regional networks be inclusive, resillient, and beautiful while also working to protect the environment and reduce city impacts.\n\n\n\nGoals\nPost-graduation, I hope to work as a planner in the public sector for a local government. Tackling affordable housing, climate action, historic preservation, land use, economic health and development, and many other opportunities and problems existing in rural and urban communities.\n\n\nData Science\nData science is a crucial factor in planning to inform decision making. My previous experience with data science has come from courses including Fundamentals of GIS, Intermediate GIS, and Urban Analytical Methods, where I have had to use various datasets to project population, calculate diversity indexes, assess housing affordability, and perform spatial and economic analyses. Without data science, the planning profession would struggle to make informed community policies and plans. Below is a GIS project I worked on in Intermediate GIS, exploring waste management service equity in Linn County, IA.\n\n\n\nGIS Project\n\n\n\n\nHobbies\nOutside academics, I love hanging out with friends, thrifting, traveling, trying new foods, and listening to music. My favorite place I have traveled to is Dublin, Ireland. My most recent travel was to Steamboat Springs, Colorado, for a field travel course, where we met with city and ski resort planners, housing administration, and historic preservation representatives to learn about the city’s housing crisis and other initiatives. My most looked forward to travel is the Spring 2026 study abroad trip to India to study transportation and smart cities.\n\nDublin, Ireland\n\n\nDSPG Goals\nThroughout my time in the DSPG Program, I look forward to expanding my data science skills by contributing to meaningful projects. I am especially excited to learn and apply coding skills for the first time. In relation to data science, I am skilled in using GIS applications, taking my time to create outputs that are done correctly and look nice, and being open and ready to learn as many new things as possible. From the DSPG Program, I would like to learn how to use Tableau to visualize analyzed data and be comfortable using Git and GitHub. The skills I wish to gain from this program will further my ability to use data science in my academic and career path. I plan to improve these skills by learning collaboratively with the other program members and implementing them into our project.\n\n\nConnect With Me!\nLinkedin"

I enjoyed the experience so much that I wanted to rejoin the following summer in 2023 with a couple of additional responsibilities. After sharing my ideas with the Community and Economic Development Extension team, I was lucky to get an assistantship that focused on improving the DSPG program with the responses we’ve received from past participants through our surveys.\nI really enjoy the DSPG program for a multitude of reasons, but here a couple of my favorites.\n\nThe program supports communal and personal learning.\n\nParticipants to the program come from varying levels of education, from first year students to PhD candidates. This usually means that everyone comes in at different skill levels and uses that to either develop the skills that they already know or learn new ones.\n\nProjects are quite varied in their goals and flexible for hands-on learning\n\nDifferent clients expect different results and for a lot of the projects, it is the exploration conducted by students that shapes the final deliverable of the projects.\n\nThe program address real questions by clients interested in learning from data.\n\nThe DSPG projects address complex and real questions about the social world making the application of data science skills extremely practical for real-world scenarios."

In other words, counties in Missouri tend to have higher median salaries as the percentage of residents with a college degree or higher increases.\n\n\nLimitations\n\nCorrelation doesn’t imply Causation\nSimplification of Race\nEstimates (Margin of Error)\nSpatial Limitation (only limited to Missouri)\nMulti-factor problem"

    "text": "Linking Pages and Images\nYou can link items in your files by using the following syntax [Text of Link](Link Reference - URL). Referencing also works for adding images into your blogs. The syntax is very similar, but requires an ! in the front. So an example would be ![Stock Photo of a Data Cat](imgs/Data_Cat.png)\n\n\n\nMy Cat Learning About Quantum Probabilities\n\n\nSince this post doesn’t specify an explicit image in the yaml, the first image in the post will be used as the thumbnail of the post. A couple of things to remember with linking images.\n\nPlace your images in the imgs directory. This helps prevent clutter and makes it easier to find the files.\nName your images explicitly. Don’t call them \"image_1.jpg\" but instead something like \"age_scatterplot_1\".\nDon’t save file names with any spaces. Add an _ or use camelCaseNaming. Spaces will prevent the blog from properly rendering!\nMake sure you follow copyright guidelines on images. Don’t add images you would not be permitted to share in any professional environment."

    "section": "Running Code",
    "text": "Running Code\n\nCode Chunks\nOne of the coolest features of the Quarto blogs is the ability to integrate code chunks and have them render. Let’s check out how this works. Here is an example of what a code chunk looks like in the source code.\n\nprint(\"I would like for this text to print.\")\n\n[1] \"I would like for this text to print.\"\n\n\nUsing different markdown arguments, we can customize our code chunks to prevent them from running, displaying, or rendering messages. You can check out some of those options through the R Markdown Reference Guide.\nSome useful ones are below.\neval=TRUE      # If FALSE, knitr will not run the code in the code chunk.\ninclude=TRUE   # If FALSE, knitr will run the chunk but not include the chunk in the final document.\necho=TRUE      # If FALSE, knitr will not display the code in the code chunk above it’s results in the final document.\nmessage=TRUE   # If FALSE, knitr will not display any messages generated by the code.\nwarning=TRUE   # If FALSE, knitr will not display any warning messages generated by the code\n\n\nUsing Data\nMost of the time, you’ll want to run some code that generates a table or a visual of your data. To do this, quarto will need a local reference to your data and that’s why your blogs also come with a directory labelled data\\. If you are working within R, it is advisable to use the .RDS format for saving any data you want to use for displaying code. Let’s look at an example.\n\n# Let's create a data frame to use\n\n## Generate pay grades as factors\nGrades &lt;- c(\"Grade A\", \"Grade B\", \"Grade C\", \"Grade D\", \"Grade E\")\nGrades_Factor &lt;- factor(Grades, levels = c(\"Grade A\", \"Grade B\", \"Grade C\", \"Grade D\", \"Grade E\"))\n\n# Create randomized vectors of size 50\nGender &lt;- sample(x = c(\"Woman\", \"Man\", \"Transgender\", \"Non-binary/non-conforming\", \"Prefer not to respond\"), size=50, replace = TRUE)\nID &lt;- sample(x = 1000:3000, size=50)\nPay &lt;- sample(x = Grades_Factor, size=50, replace=TRUE)\n\n# Create data frame\ndf &lt;- data.frame(Gender, ID, Pay)\n\nIn our example here we’ve created the data in our blog environment, but often this will not be the case. We are going to pretend that our data is stored in the data directory. We will first save the data we created.\n\n# Saving our dataset\nsaveRDS(df, file = \"data/PayData.RDS\")\n\nNow we can load it in as Pay_DF.\n\nPay_DF &lt;- readRDS(\"data/PayData.RDS\")\n\nLet’s write some code with ggplot2 to create a visual.\n\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\npay_colors &lt;- c(\"Grade A\" = \"#1f78b4\", \"Grade B\" = \"#33a02c\", \"Grade C\" = \"#e31a1c\", \"Grade D\" = \"#ff7f00\", \"Grade E\" = \"#6a3d9a\")\n\nggplot(Pay_DF, aes(x = Gender, fill = Pay)) +\n  geom_bar() +\n  labs(x = \"Gender\", y = \"Count\", title = \"Distribution of Pay Grades Across Genders\") +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = pay_colors) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  coord_flip()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nData Guidelines\nHere are some important things to consider when you’re using data sets in your blogs.\n\nVERY IMPORTANT: All data saved in the data directory is publicly visible. Don’t share data that is private into your blogs.\nBe mindful of the size of your data. The larger the data, the longer it will take to render. GitHub also limits commit sizes so keep this in mind."

Quarto Markdown files have the ability to change the rendering engine so that other languages can also be used. To run both Python and R, you will have to have the reticulate library installed and configured. When you’ve created a code chunk, you will want to switch the section that is typically in the form of {r} to {python} or whatever other supported language you wish to use.\nHere is a Python code block.\n\nimport platform\n\nprint(\"This code is run using python version\", platform.python_version())\n\nThis code is run using python version 3.13.1"

It is unclear how extensive these resources are and how effectively they can be mobilized to support STEM education development. Additionally, a deeper understanding is needed of the factors influencing students’ decisions to pursue STEM education in Iowa, such as access to local job opportunities, educational infrastructure, participation in science fairs, and extracurricular programs. This project seeks to address these gaps by developing a centralized, user-friendly data repository along with visualization tools that present clear and contextual information. These resources will serve Iowa’s policymakers, educators, advocates, and community stakeholders by informing strategic decisions, guiding investments, and supporting targeted policy interventions to strengthen STEM education throughout the state.\nProject Sponsor: ISU Community and Economic Development\n\n\n\nHealthy Community Capitals\nThe Community Capitals project seeks to explore the relationship between community capital indicators and the overall condition of communities in Iowa, aiming to identify strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and gaps within these communities. The main work focuses on major events such as natural disasters, job losses, new job creation, school closures, and new opportunities for tourism and healthcare. The study seeks to identify the most relevant community capitals, trends over time, and the impact on community resiliency, by analyzing correlations between various indicators and comparing quantitative data with some qualitative insights.\nProject Sponsor: ISU Community and Economic Development"

    "section": "",
    "text": "Housing affordability has become an increasingly pressing issue across the United States, with Iowa being no exception. As median home values continue to rise, understanding the relationship between household income and housing characteristics is very important.\nThis report examines the correlation between income and housing characteristics in Iowa from 2005 to 2023, spanning nearly two decades of economic changes including the 2008 financial crisis, its recovery, and 2020-2021 COVID Pandemic. By analyzing American Community Survey (ACS) data, we investigate how the percentage of income spent on housing has evolved over time and explore the relationship between personal earnings and housing payments.\nThe analysis focuses on five key research questions:\n\nHow has the percentage of household income spent on housing costs changed in Iowa from 2005 to 2023?\nThe changes in income compared to the median cost of a house\nOwnership vs rent from 2005-2023\nHow do mortgage rates affect house ownership\nHow have major events affected the housing situation in Iowa\n\nUnderstanding these trends is essential for assessing housing affordability and identifying potential policy interventions to support Iowa residents in accessing affordable housing options.\n\n\n\n\nCode\ndf_long &lt;- read.csv(\"data/median_income_house_prices.csv\")\nyears &lt;- c(2005:2019, 2021, 2022, 2023)\n\nggplot(df_long, aes(x = year, y = value, color = variable)) +\n  geom_line(linewidth = 1.2) +\n  geom_point(size = 2) +\n  scale_x_continuous(breaks = years) +\n  scale_y_continuous(labels = comma) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Progression of Median House Prices and Income in Iowa (2005–2023)\",\n    x = \"Year\",\n    y = \"USD\",\n    color = \"Variable\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHousehold income from 2005 to 2023 compared to the median house price has not kept pace with the increase in housing costs.

These bigger states show steeper increases during boom periods and more pronounced dips during market corrections, while states like Iowa, North Dakota, South Dakota, and Nebraska maintain relatively steady, linear growth patterns throughout the time period.\n\n\n\nThe housing market crash of 2008-2012, fueled by the subprime mortgage crisis, saw major housing price drops across the US, with some states experiencing more severe declines than others. These price drops were primarily driven by the inability of many homeowners to repay their mortgages, leading to a surge in foreclosures and a glut of homes on the market (Weinberg, n.d.).\n\n\n\nAccording to Capozza et al. (2002), “variation in the cyclical behavior of real house prices across metropolitan areas is due to more than just variation in local economies. House prices react differently to economic shocks depending on such factors as growth rates, area size, and construction costs.”\nIn short, what influences housing prices? Housing supply, population growth, urbanization, regulatory constraints, and interest rates (Steers Global Real Assets 2025).\n\n\nCode\ngdp &lt;- read.csv(\"data/Real_GDP_for_the_State_of_Iowa__Most_Recent_Quarterly_Estimates_20250530.csv\")\n\ngdp$Real.GDP.Billions &lt;- gdp$Real.GDP / 1000000000\n\nggplot(gdp, aes(x = reorder(Industry, Real.GDP), y = Real.GDP.Billions)) +\n  geom_col(fill = \"steelblue\", alpha = 0.7) +\n  coord_flip() +\n  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::comma) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Real GDP by Industry for Iowa (Q2 2024)\",\n    x = \"Industry\",\n    y = \"Real GDP (Billions $)\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    axis.text.y = element_text(size = 9),\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 14, hjust = 0.5)\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom the GDP composition chart, we can see that Iowa relies heavily on manufacturing, agriculture, and other traditional industries that provide economic stability (data.iowa.gov, n.d.). The state’s diversified economy, with significant contributions from manufacturing, finance, and agriculture sectors, creates a more resilient economic foundation that helps maintain steady housing demand without the speculative bubbles seen in tech-heavy or finance-dominated markets.\nIowa has maintained relatively stable housing prices due to several key factors: steady economic growth without dramatic booms or busts, a stable economy, lower regulatory constraints compared to coastal states, and more balanced housing supply. Additionally, Iowa’s smaller metropolitan areas and lower construction costs have contributed to this stability, making the state less susceptible to the extreme price volatility experienced in larger, more speculative housing markets.\n\n\n\nThe analysis shows that household income does not correlate with the rate of homeownership in Iowa, but rather that there are numerous variables in the equation. Despite disproportional growth between household income and house prices, the actual cost of owning a house has decreased significantly since 2005. It is also worth noting that Iowa’s financial growth was not heavily impacted by major financial crises. This is due to its reliance on a more stable manufacturing-based economy as shown in its GDP composition. A significant reason why it is so stable is that housing prices in Iowa are only 3 times the yearly household income, which is one of the lowest ratios in the country. In contrast, in bigger states, despite massive swings, the ratio between housing prices and income remains significantly higher."

I realize that even when we met the functional requirements a client required, sometimes the client was unhappy or demotivated to use the software we built, and that is because our team focused on the technical specifications and not the most critical element of a system: the person.\n\n\nMy future plans\nI plan to return to my country and start a company focused on UX research! I also want to join the Academy.\n\n\nWhy I care about data science\nData Science is important because it supports the decision-making process. During my previous job, I noticed the importance of data and how it can be used to predict or classify things.\n\n\nPrevious experience in Data Science\n\nIn my previous job, I created a flow to extract information from SonnarQube, a static code vulnerability analysis tool. I took the analysis into a database and made a dashboard in PowerBI that my boss used to see our team’s top 10 vulnerabilities when coding. That helped us to look for specific training.\nI also worked on a project where I used a web-scrapping tool and created a linear model to predict the value of some assets based on the information collected from the web.\n\n\n\nFun facts\nI have two dogs, Franky and Bruno.\n\n\n\nPicture by me\n\n\nThis is Bruno coding in R Studio:\n\n\n\nPicture by me\n\n\nI also spend a lot of time playing chess (if you play chess, find me on Chess.com as JYassGt), playing video games, and reading.\n\n\nMy skills\nI can quickly learn new technical stuff, integrate data from many sources, and clean it.\n\n\nThe skills I want to learn\n\nGoing deep into my Python skills.\nLearn about using geographic visualization tools.\nLearn to use ArcGIS\n\nMastering Python skills is important for this project and my research, where I experiment with LLMs’ APIs. I also recognize maps’ value in presenting information and want to add to my tools arsenal.\nI hope to achieve my skill goals by a hands-on approach trough these 9 weeks."

    "text": "Why Data Science?\nAs a high schooler trying to figure out what to do with their life, I contemplated the list of majors I could pursue. I had never heard of data science before. When I googled it, I saw a world of possibiliies open up before me. In today’s world there is data on everything and it’s used in every industry. I was particularly intrigued by data science as a tool in government. Passionate about helping the government make informed decisions and helping people, I chose to pursue DS!\n\nWhy Russian Studies?\nInitially, I never planned to take Russian course at ISU. After trying out the film studies class as an elective I decided to pursue a minor in Russian studies. It would help me connect to my culture and hone my language skills. More than that, Russian is a critical language with importance in global affairs. As someone who wants to work in the government, knowing the language and culture of a politically significant nation felt natural."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Overview\nThis census report examines various socioeconomic factors for census tracts within Polk and Linn County, Iowa. Through the use of scatterplots, static maps, and interactive maps, we can explore correlations between variables and better understand local challenges. This report utilizes the American Community Survey (ACS) 2021 5-Year Estimates, with a focus on analyzing:\n\n“B17001_002” : Population below the poverty line\n“B08201_002” : Households without access to a vehicle\n“B23025_005” : Unemployment rates\n\n\n\nPoverty by Census Tract\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe poverty maps above show percentage of the population in poverty across census tracts in Polk and Linn counties. The maps reveal a clear concentration of poverty in relation to the urban cores of Cedar Rapids and Des Moines. Yet, Des Moines’ distribution of high poverty areas is a little more dispersed across the metropolitan area than Cedar Rapids. The gray tract in the Polk County map represents an airport tract with a population of zero.\n\n\nPoverty and Vehicle Access\n\nLinn County\n\n\n\n\nPolk County\n\n\nThe interactive poverty and vehicle access maps above show poverty percentages by census tract, with green circles sized according to the number of households without vehicle access, revealing relationships between the two. Both maps show strong overlaps of high poverty and low vehicle access. Low vehicle access in Polk County is much more dispersed than in Linn County, with large dots reaching much farther than just the tracts near Des Moines’ urban core. By tapping on a tract or green dot, a pop up appears with the percent of people in poverty or the number of households without a vehicle in the corresponding tract.\n\nThe scatterplot above shows households without a vehicle on the x-axis and people in poverty on the y-axis to explore correlations between the two variables. Each dot represents a single census tract. The purple line and dots represent Polk County and the orange line and dots represent Linn County. The trend line indicates a positive correlation in both counties, showing as the number of people in poverty increases, so does the amount of households without a vehicle.\n\n\n\nUnemployment Rate by Census Tract\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe unemployment maps above show percentage of unemployment across census tracts in Linn and Polk counties. The maps reveal a clear concentration of unemployment in tracts near and around the urban cores of Cedar Rapids and Des Moines. Polk County shows a much larger amount of tracts of high unemployment than Linn County. The bottom gray census tract in the Polk County map represents an airport tract with no data, the two other gray tracts had too high of unemployment to be shown in comparison with Linn County while keeping a plausible scale.\n\n\nUnemployment and Poverty\n\nThe scatterplot above shows unemployment on the x-axis and poverty on the y-axis to explore correlations between the two variables. Each dot represents a single census tract. The purple line and dots represent Polk County and the orange line and dots represent Linn County. The trend line indicates a positive correlation in both counties, showing as poverty increases, so does unemployment and vice versa."

The chart below breaks down the weighted count of people by sex and by the type(s) of insurance coverage they reported in the 2023 ACS.\nEach respondent may report more than one type of insurance, so categories are not mutually exclusive. For instance, a person might be covered by both employer-based insurance and Medicare.\nKey findings include:\nEmployer-based insurance is the most common type of coverage for both males and females, reflecting its central role in the U.S. healthcare system.\nMedicare and Medicaid follow, with slightly higher Medicaid coverage among females, likely due to eligibility related to caregiving roles and pregnancy.\nTRICARE and VA coverage are more popular among males, reflecting the gender distribution in military service.\nDirect purchase insurance shows relatively equal distribution, though this market typically includes self-employed individuals and those without employer-sponsored options.\nThese patterns show how insurance access pathways vary by sex and are shaped by employment, age, veteran status, and caregiving responsibilities."

The uninsured rate is slightly higher among males, a finding that aligns with broader national trends on gender and coverage gaps.\nIn terms of types of insurance coverage, the analysis shows that:\nEmployer-based insurance is the most common coverage type for both sexes.\nSpatially, I used ACS table B27001 to obtain counts of uninsured individuals (B27001_005) and total population (B27001_001). These were joined to calculate the uninsured percentage, visualized in a choropleth map. Most counties had low uninsured rates (&lt;2%), but subtle differences were visible."
