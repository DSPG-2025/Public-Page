I’m excited to be a part of this summer’s data science intern cohort and share a bit about myself, my experiences, and my goals. I hope this blog not only introduces who I am but also serves as a reflection of my growth and learning over the course of the program.\n\n\n\nHi! My name is Tanisha Magikar. I’m originally from India and currently an upcoming junior at Iowa State University, majoring in Computer Science with a minor in Data Science. I chose this field because I love solving problems with technology and creating solutions that can positively impact people’s lives. I’m especially passionate about how data can be used to tell stories, make decisions, and drive innovation in everything from healthcare to finance.\n\n\n\nWith my degree, I plan to work in software or data engineering. I want to help build systems that are smart, ethical, and accessible. Data science, to me, is the bridge between raw information and meaningful impact. Whether it’s analyzing protein structures or building recommendation engines, I care about using data responsibly and creatively.\n\n\n\nI’ve been fortunate to gain hands-on experience through multiple avenues. As a backend developer at the Nannovaccine Institute, I worked on a Python-based system to organize and analyze over 1,000 Hydrolase protein properties, my first deep dive into using data science in bioinformatics.\nI’ve also developed full-stack applications, including:\n\nShopTune — a React-based e-commerce platform featuring a built-in music player for an interactive shopping experience. Github\nCYNANCE — an Android finance app that leverages AI to offer personalized budgeting and spending recommendations.Demo\n\nAlongside technical projects, I work as an IT Support Specialist at Iowa State’s College of Liberal Arts and Sciences, helping resolve technical issues for students and faculty. I’ve also served as a Peer Mentor for the Computer Science department and as Multicultural Awareness Director on the Student Union Board, where I led campus-wide initiatives for inclusivity.\n\n \n\n\n\n\nWhen I’m not coding, you’ll find me reading, listening to music, or travelling!\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nI appreciate my curiosity, adaptability, and ability to explain complex concepts clearly.

    "text": "Overview\nHello! My name is Madison Herdlicka and I am from Cedar Rapids, IA. In Fall 2025, I will be a Junior majoring in Community and Regional Planning and minoring in Environmental Studies. I chose my academic career path to help communites and regional networks be inclusive, resillient, and beautiful while also working to protect the environment and reduce city impacts.\n\n\n\nGoals\nPost-graduation, I hope to work as a planner in the public sector for a local government. Tackling affordable housing, climate action, historic preservation, land use, economic health and development, and many other opportunities and problems existing in rural and urban communities.\n\n\nData Science\nData science is a crucial factor in planning to inform decision making. My previous experience with data science has come from courses including Fundamentals of GIS, Intermediate GIS, and Urban Analytical Methods, where I have had to use various datasets to project population, calculate diversity indexes, assess housing affordability, and perform spatial and economic analyses. Without data science, the planning profession would struggle to make informed community policies and plans. Below is a GIS project I worked on in Intermediate GIS, exploring waste management service equity in Linn County, IA.\n\n\n\nGIS Project\n\n\n\n\nHobbies\nOutside academics, I love hanging out with friends, thrifting, traveling, trying new foods, and listening to music. My favorite place I have traveled to is Dublin, Ireland. My most recent travel was to Steamboat Springs, Colorado, for a field travel course, where we met with city and ski resort planners, housing administration, and historic preservation representatives to learn about the city’s housing crisis and other initiatives. My most looked forward to travel is the Spring 2026 study abroad trip to India to study transportation and smart cities.\n\nDublin, Ireland\n\n\nDSPG Goals\nThroughout my time in the DSPG Program, I look forward to expanding my data science skills by contributing to meaningful projects. I am especially excited to learn and apply coding skills for the first time. In relation to data science, I am skilled in using GIS applications, taking my time to create outputs that are done correctly and look nice, and being open and ready to learn as many new things as possible. From the DSPG Program, I would like to learn how to use Tableau to visualize analyzed data and be comfortable using Git and GitHub. The skills I wish to gain from this program will further my ability to use data science in my academic and career path. I plan to improve these skills by learning collaboratively with the other program members and implementing them into our project.\n\n\nConnect With Me!\nLinkedin"

I enjoyed the experience so much that I wanted to rejoin the following summer in 2023 with a couple of additional responsibilities. After sharing my ideas with the Community and Economic Development Extension team, I was lucky to get an assistantship that focused on improving the DSPG program with the responses we’ve received from past participants through our surveys.\nI really enjoy the DSPG program for a multitude of reasons, but here a couple of my favorites.\n\nThe program supports communal and personal learning.\n\nParticipants to the program come from varying levels of education, from first year students to PhD candidates. This usually means that everyone comes in at different skill levels and uses that to either develop the skills that they already know or learn new ones.\n\nProjects are quite varied in their goals and flexible for hands-on learning\n\nDifferent clients expect different results and for a lot of the projects, it is the exploration conducted by students that shapes the final deliverable of the projects.\n\nThe program address real questions by clients interested in learning from data.\n\nThe DSPG projects address complex and real questions about the social world making the application of data science skills extremely practical for real-world scenarios."

It is unclear how extensive these resources are and how effectively they can be mobilized to support STEM education development. Additionally, a deeper understanding is needed of the factors influencing students’ decisions to pursue STEM education in Iowa, such as access to local job opportunities, educational infrastructure, participation in science fairs, and extracurricular programs. This project seeks to address these gaps by developing a centralized, user-friendly data repository along with visualization tools that present clear and contextual information. These resources will serve Iowa’s policymakers, educators, advocates, and community stakeholders by informing strategic decisions, guiding investments, and supporting targeted policy interventions to strengthen STEM education throughout the state.\nProject Sponsor: ISU Community and Economic Development\n\n\n\nHealthy Community Capitals\nThe Community Capitals project seeks to explore the relationship between community capital indicators and the overall condition of communities in Iowa, aiming to identify strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and gaps within these communities. The main work focuses on major events such as natural disasters, job losses, new job creation, school closures, and new opportunities for tourism and healthcare. The study seeks to identify the most relevant community capitals, trends over time, and the impact on community resiliency, by analyzing correlations between various indicators and comparing quantitative data with some qualitative insights.\nProject Sponsor: ISU Community and Economic Development"

    "text": "Linking Pages and Images\nYou can link items in your files by using the following syntax [Text of Link](Link Reference - URL). Referencing also works for adding images into your blogs. The syntax is very similar, but requires an ! in the front. So an example would be ![Stock Photo of a Data Cat](imgs/Data_Cat.png)\n\n\n\nMy Cat Learning About Quantum Probabilities\n\n\nSince this post doesn’t specify an explicit image in the yaml, the first image in the post will be used as the thumbnail of the post. A couple of things to remember with linking images.\n\nPlace your images in the imgs directory. This helps prevent clutter and makes it easier to find the files.\nName your images explicitly. Don’t call them \"image_1.jpg\" but instead something like \"age_scatterplot_1\".\nDon’t save file names with any spaces. Add an _ or use camelCaseNaming. Spaces will prevent the blog from properly rendering!\nMake sure you follow copyright guidelines on images. Don’t add images you would not be permitted to share in any professional environment."

    "section": "Running Code",
    "text": "Running Code\n\nCode Chunks\nOne of the coolest features of the Quarto blogs is the ability to integrate code chunks and have them render. Let’s check out how this works. Here is an example of what a code chunk looks like in the source code.\n\nprint(\"I would like for this text to print.\")\n\n[1] \"I would like for this text to print.\"\n\n\nUsing different markdown arguments, we can customize our code chunks to prevent them from running, displaying, or rendering messages. You can check out some of those options through the R Markdown Reference Guide.\nSome useful ones are below.\neval=TRUE      # If FALSE, knitr will not run the code in the code chunk.\ninclude=TRUE   # If FALSE, knitr will run the chunk but not include the chunk in the final document.\necho=TRUE      # If FALSE, knitr will not display the code in the code chunk above it’s results in the final document.\nmessage=TRUE   # If FALSE, knitr will not display any messages generated by the code.\nwarning=TRUE   # If FALSE, knitr will not display any warning messages generated by the code\n\n\nUsing Data\nMost of the time, you’ll want to run some code that generates a table or a visual of your data. To do this, quarto will need a local reference to your data and that’s why your blogs also come with a directory labelled data\\. If you are working within R, it is advisable to use the .RDS format for saving any data you want to use for displaying code. Let’s look at an example.\n\n# Let's create a data frame to use\n\n## Generate pay grades as factors\nGrades &lt;- c(\"Grade A\", \"Grade B\", \"Grade C\", \"Grade D\", \"Grade E\")\nGrades_Factor &lt;- factor(Grades, levels = c(\"Grade A\", \"Grade B\", \"Grade C\", \"Grade D\", \"Grade E\"))\n\n# Create randomized vectors of size 50\nGender &lt;- sample(x = c(\"Woman\", \"Man\", \"Transgender\", \"Non-binary/non-conforming\", \"Prefer not to respond\"), size=50, replace = TRUE)\nID &lt;- sample(x = 1000:3000, size=50)\nPay &lt;- sample(x = Grades_Factor, size=50, replace=TRUE)\n\n# Create data frame\ndf &lt;- data.frame(Gender, ID, Pay)\n\nIn our example here we’ve created the data in our blog environment, but often this will not be the case. We are going to pretend that our data is stored in the data directory. We will first save the data we created.\n\n# Saving our dataset\nsaveRDS(df, file = \"data/PayData.RDS\")\n\nNow we can load it in as Pay_DF.\n\nPay_DF &lt;- readRDS(\"data/PayData.RDS\")\n\nLet’s write some code with ggplot2 to create a visual.\n\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\npay_colors &lt;- c(\"Grade A\" = \"#1f78b4\", \"Grade B\" = \"#33a02c\", \"Grade C\" = \"#e31a1c\", \"Grade D\" = \"#ff7f00\", \"Grade E\" = \"#6a3d9a\")\n\nggplot(Pay_DF, aes(x = Gender, fill = Pay)) +\n  geom_bar() +\n  labs(x = \"Gender\", y = \"Count\", title = \"Distribution of Pay Grades Across Genders\") +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = pay_colors) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  coord_flip()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nData Guidelines\nHere are some important things to consider when you’re using data sets in your blogs.\n\nVERY IMPORTANT: All data saved in the data directory is publicly visible. Don’t share data that is private into your blogs.\nBe mindful of the size of your data. The larger the data, the longer it will take to render. GitHub also limits commit sizes so keep this in mind."

Quarto Markdown files have the ability to change the rendering engine so that other languages can also be used. To run both Python and R, you will have to have the reticulate library installed and configured. When you’ve created a code chunk, you will want to switch the section that is typically in the form of {r} to {python} or whatever other supported language you wish to use.\nHere is a Python code block.\n\nimport platform\n\nprint(\"This code is run using python version\", platform.python_version())\n\nThis code is run using python version 3.13.1"

    "text": "Hello! My name is Jorge Yass, and you can call me Jorge. I am from Guatemala and was born in a beautiful small city called Antigua Guatemala:\n\n\n\nPicture by Chad Davis - https://www.flickr.com/photos/146321178@N05/49640785242/\n\n\nBefore coming to the US, I worked for 9 years as a software engineer at a financial institution, where I worked mainly with relational databases and C#. My background is in Information Systems and Cybersecurity.\n\nAcademic year and degree\nI am about to start my fourth year in a PhD in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) and a co-major in Computer Engineering. My current research is about exploring students’ mental models of the Internet to identify misconceptions, to inform the design/implementation of video games to teach cybersecurity concepts.\nI chose my major because of the experiences I had as a software engineer. I realize that even when we met the functional requirements a client required, sometimes the client was unhappy or demotivated to use the software we built, and that is because our team focused on the technical specifications and not the most critical element of a system: the person.\n\n\nMy future plans\nI plan to return to my country and start a company focused on UX research! I also want to join the Academy.\n\n\nWhy I care about data science\nData Science is important because it supports the decision-making process. During my previous job, I noticed the importance of data and how it can be used to predict or classify things.\n\n\nPrevious experience in Data Science\n\nIn my previous job, I created a flow to extract information from SonnarQube, a static code vulnerability analysis tool. I took the analysis into a database and made a dashboard in PowerBI that my boss used to see our team’s top 10 vulnerabilities when coding. That helped us to look for specific training.\nI also worked on a project where I used a web-scrapping tool and created a linear model to predict the value of some assets based on the information collected from the web.\n\n\n\nFun facts\nI have two dogs, Franky and Bruno.\n\n\n\nPicture by me\n\n\nThis is Bruno coding in R Studio:\n\n\n\nPicture by me\n\n\nI also spend a lot of time playing chess (if you play chess, find me on Chess.com as JYassGt), playing video games, and reading.\n\n\nMy skills\nI can quickly learn new technical stuff, integrate data from many sources, and clean it.\n\n\nThe skills I want to learn\n\nGoing deep into my Python skills.\nLearn about using geographic visualization tools.\nLearn to use ArcGIS\n\nMastering Python skills is important for this project and my research, where I experiment with LLMs’ APIs. I also recognize maps’ value in presenting information and want to add to my tools arsenal.\nI hope to achieve my skill goals by a hands-on approach trough these 9 weeks."

When I googled it, I saw a world of possibiliies open up before me. In today’s world there is data on everything and it’s used in every industry. I was particularly intrigued by data science as a tool in government. Passionate about helping the government make informed decisions and helping people, I chose to pursue DS!\n\nWhy Russian Studies?\nInitially, I never planned to take Russian course at ISU. After trying out the film studies class as an elective I decided to pursue a minor in Russian studies. It would help me connect to my culture and hone my language skills. More than that, Russian is a critical language with importance in global affairs. As someone who wants to work in the government, knowing the language and culture of a politically significant nation felt natural."
